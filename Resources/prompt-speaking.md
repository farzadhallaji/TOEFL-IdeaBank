Prepare a comprehensive response for the TOEFL iBT Speaking section, focusing predominantly on the first section (Content Creation), with detailed consideration of the TOEFL speaking rubrics. The response should be structured into four key sections as follows:

1. **Content Creation with Rubric Alignment:**
   - Develop a detailed speaking outline on the provided topic, using vocabulary and collocations from the attached files. Incorporate at least 20 specific collocations, ensuring they naturally integrate into the speech. Adjust the content to maintain a smooth and natural flow, necessary for high scoring according to TOEFL speaking rubrics. Include additional academic collocations useful for TOEFL preparation. Focus particularly on demonstrating clear and coherent speech (delivery), precise and appropriate language use (language use), and well-developed responses that logically address the topic (topic development).

2. **Brainstorming and Ideas:**
   - List innovative brainstorming ideas relevant to the topic, providing a brief explanation for each on how it could be developed into a structured speaking response. Highlight how these ideas can align with TOEFL scoring criteria, particularly focusing on fluency, coherence, and topical relevance.

3. **Sample Answer:**
   - Craft a sample answer to the specified TOEFL speaking question based on the brainstormed ideas. Ensure the response is coherent, fluently delivered, and demonstrates effective use of targeted vocabulary and collocations. The sample should adhere strictly to the TOEFL speaking rubrics, ideally within a 45-second delivery window.

4. **Reference to Vocabulary and Collocations:**
   - Provide a detailed list of all collocations and vocabulary terms used in the sample answer, indicating their source from the provided file. This should aid in transparency and facilitate easy reference and learning.

Ensure each section of the response is distinctly marked and elaborates on how the content can meet the TOEFL speaking sectionâ€™s scoring criteria, providing a practical and educational insight into creating a high-scoring TOEFL speaking response.

more Explanation:

Act as TOEFL coach. Write passages for oral (contents and materials) just about the question and topic. 

you must use at least 15-20 collocations of files [collocations.csv](collocations.csv) which I provided if it's possible, and bold them in your response.

Also I have provided [Perplexity-AI.md](Perplexity-AI.md) file which you could use them also you can bring another ideas which are helpful for brainstorming about the topic and question. 

so the content (first part of your response) should be suitable for oral speaking (want to convert to speech) and must be about the question and topic and contains ideas and brain storming and collocations.  the content I need is the one that I can learn **grammar** from the sentences, and **collocations**, and contains **ideas** and **brain storming** (I want to get highest score in speaking and writing section in TOEFL). 

So your response should be like this:

- Part one: the passage and the content I have mentioned earlier. the passage and the content I have mentioned earlier. but consider that I dont want a podcast introductions, just a content which is suitable for oral speaking and it's fine about 5-6 paragraphs.

- Part two: In the *second* part of your response you should give me a sample answer for the question at the exam (your response should be about 35-40 seconds for not native speaker,  and also for writing questions I have about 10 minutes to write the answer completely) 

  the sample must get highest score according to rubrics I provided.

  for the question [Speaking]; you should provide the sample (second part of your response) according to the Speaking rubric and for the question [Writing]; you should provide the sample (second part of your response) according to the Writing rubric. I just want one sample corresponding to the skill.

  the sample must get highest score according to rubrics I provided.

- Part three: In the Third part of your response, you should write the reasons with their general topics with brief explanation for each one. I need it for idea bank and brain storming. so write it more general ideas to remember.

- Part four: At the end of your response you must write list of used collocations (not any just collocations from collocation.csv file I have provided) with their corresponding number of rows in the correspond file, It's really important to don't made them up from yourself and really important to use of them.

| Score | General Description                                          | Delivery                                                     | Language Use                                                 | Topic Development                                            |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 4     | The response fulfills the demands of the task, with a mature response in a complex issue. It is highly intelligible and exhibits sustained, coherent discourse. Characterized by a level of response at this level is the following: | Generally well-paced flow (but it may include speech disruptions). Smooth transitions, minor difficulties with pauses, or articulation not compromising flow or overall intelligibility. | The response demonstrates vocabulary usage of familiarity with diverse registers and a high degree of automaticity and good control of basic syntactic structures (as appropriate). Some minor (or not) disturbances are noticeable. | Response is sustained and sufficient to develop the topic. Reveals the well-linked ties between relationships (where it's clear as progression of ideas). |
| 3     | The response addresses the task appropriately but may fall short of being fully developed. It is generally intelligible and coherent, with some fluidity of expression, though it exhibits the gaps in the level of ideas. A response at this level is characterized by the omission of the following: | Speech is generally clear, with some fluidity of expression, though minor difficulties with pronunciation, intonation, or pacing are noticeable and may require listener effort (but are not significantly affected). | The response demonstrates fairly uniform and articulate syntax but some more advanced structures or vocabulary could help. Response may reflect inconsistencies or limited use of more advanced syntactic structures or grammatical structures in the language sometimes used. The tone may not seriously influence but it does affect overall fluency with the communication partner. | Response is mostly coherent and sustained and conveys relevant information. Overall development is somewhat limited, usually lacks elaboration, or perspective relationships between ideas may at times not be immediately clear. |
| 2     | The response addresses the task but is incomplete, contains problems, is disjointed without overall coherence or sustained meaning with delivery and/or problems may be accured in places. A response at this level is characterized by at least two of the following: | Speech is basically intelligible, though listener effort is needed because of unclear articulation, awkward intonation, or choppy rhythm/pace; meaning may be obscured in places. | The response demonstrates limited grammar and vocabulary. Mistakes and conflicts of expression are bad for the interpretation of ideas. Sentence structures vary but feel constant, must express, and successfully support plain vocabulary (may errors and simplicity occur). | The response is disconnected to the task, though the number of ideas presented are limited. Mostly basic ideas is elaborated with limited support. At times vaguely expressed may be relevant to subtopic or interpretations. Communication issues. |
| 1     | The response is very limited in content and/or coherence or is unintelligible. A response at this level is mainly characterized by at least two of the following: | Consistent pronunciation, stress and intonation difficulties, considerably choppier, fragmented delivery is likely; frequent pauses, or considerable stammer, stutter, and hesitations. | Range and control of grammar and vocabulary significantly limited. Constant expression ideas and prevention errors may come or become annoying of less formally recognized or previously on practised. | Limited relevant content is expressed. The response generally lacks substance beyond superficial or very basic ideas. Depends may be unable to sustain and may heavily repeat the task specified to complete on repetition of the prompt. |
| 0     | Speaker makes no attempt to respond OR response is unrelated to the topic. |                                                              |                                                              |                                                              |
