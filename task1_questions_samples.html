Personally, I prefer to watch educational programs rather than entertainment TV programs. The reason for this is that I find educational programs to be more enriching and informative. They provide me with the opportunity to learn new things, expand my knowledge, and gain a deeper understanding of various subjects. Whether it's documentaries, science shows, or historical programs, educational TV allows me to explore different topics in a captivating and engaging way. On the other hand, while entertainment programs can be enjoyable and provide a form of relaxation, they often lack the educational value that I seek. Ultimately, I believe that investing my time in educational programs not only entertains me but also broadens my horizons.

I personally prefer to watch entertainment TV programs. I believe that educational programs offer valuable knowledge and insights; however, entertainment programs provide a much-needed escape from the stresses of daily life. They offer a chance to relax, unwind, and be entertained by captivating storylines, humor, and talented actors. Entertainment programs allow me to immerse myself in different worlds, experience a range of emotions, and simply enjoy the art of storytelling. Additionally, they serve as a form of entertainment and a source of shared experiences, fostering conversations and connections with friends and family. Ultimately, I would choose entertainment programs over anything.

        <div class="question">
            Some think that natural talent and ability are more important for an athlete; others think that hard work is more important. What do you think?
        </div>

In my personal view, natural talent and ability hold greater significance for an athlete's success. While hard work and dedication are undoubtedly valuable, innate abilities provide athletes with a unique advantage that cannot be easily replicated through effort alone. Natural talent, such as exceptional speed, agility, or hand-eye coordination, sets athletes apart from their competitors from the very beginning. While hard work can enhance these abilities, it is the natural talent that serves as a solid foundation to build upon. Moreover, natural ability often determines the upper limit of an athlete's potential.

In my perspective, hard work outweighs natural talent and ability when it comes to an athlete's success. While natural talent may provide a head start, it is the relentless effort and dedication that truly propel athletes to greatness. Hard work allows athletes to develop their skills, improve their weaknesses, and push their limits. It builds discipline, resilience, and mental fortitude, which are crucial in competitive sports. Moreover, hard work can compensate for any shortcomings in natural ability and talent. Through consistent practice, athletes can enhance their performance and surpass those who rely solely on their innate gifts.

I personally prefer listening to recorded music. Recorded music offers a level of convenience and flexibility that live performances cannot always provide. With recorded music, I have the freedom to choose what I want to listen to, when and where I want to listen to it. I can explore a wide variety of genres and artists, and have access to an extensive library of songs at my fingerprints. Additionally, recorded music allows me to enjoy the intricacies and details of the music through high-quality recordings and production. While live performances have their own unique charm, I find the convenience and control of recorded music more suitable for my personal listening preferences. So that’s why I prefer listening to recorded music.

I prefer going to live music performances for three main reasons. Firstly, it allows me to spend quality time with my friends and my family. Attending concerts together creates lasting memories and strengthens our bond through shared experiences. Secondly, live performances offer superior music quality. The raw, unfiltered sound of musicians playing … their instruments and singing live adds an authenticity that recorded music sometimes lacks. The energy and passion of the performers can be felt in every note, making the music even more captivating. Finally, I think live music performances provide a unique experience. The atmosphere, the crowd's energy… they all create an immersive and unforgettable experience.

I agree with the statement that the most important lessons can't be learned in a classroom. While formal education provides valuable knowledge and skills, there are certain life lessons that can only be acquired through real-world experiences. Classroom learning often focuses on theoretical concepts and academic achievement, whereas crucial lessons such as resilience, empathy, and adaptability are best learned through personal encounters and challenges outside the classroom. These experiences teach us how to navigate complex situations, understand different perspectives, and develop crucial life skills that cannot be fully grasped within the limitations of a classroom. So that’s why I believe some lessons cannot be learned in a classroom.

I disagree with the statement that the most important lessons can't be learned in a classroom. Firstly, classrooms provide a structured learning environment that fosters discipline and critical thinking. In my personal experience, during my time in university, I was exposed to various challenging courses that required me to think critically, analyze information, and solve complex problems. Secondly, classrooms offer opportunities for interaction and collaboration with peers and instructors. Through group discussions, debates, and presentations, I learned how to effectively communicate my ideas, listen to others, and work collaboratively towards a common goal. These are the two reasons why I think classrooms are beneficial.

Personally, I prefer shopping in smaller shops rather than large shopping malls. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, smaller shops tend to offer a more personalized and intimate shopping experience. The staff in smaller shops often provide individualized attention and are more knowledgeable about their products, making the shopping process more enjoyable and efficient. Additionally, uh … shopping in smaller shops supports local businesses and the local economy, which is something I value. It gives me a sense of satisfaction to know that my purchases are directly benefiting the community. Overall, the charm and personalized service, and support for local businesses are the two main reasons why I prefer shopping in smaller shops.

I personally prefer shopping from large shopping malls. Um… I feel this way for two reasons. I think that one advantage of large malls is the sheer variety and abundance of stores they offer. From high-end luxury brands to budget-friendly options, large malls provide a one-stop shopping destination for all kinds of products and styles. In addition, I think that large malls often have extensive food courts and entertainment facilities, making them a convenient and enjoyable place to spend a whole day. So, ... .Overall, the convenience, wide range of options, and additional amenities make shopping in large malls a popular… choice for everyone.

As a teacher, I believe it is better for students to send questions about coursework and assignments by email. Email communication allows for a more organized and efficient exchange of information. When students email their questions, they have the opportunity to clearly articulate their concerns and provide any necessary context. This helps me as a teacher to better understand their needs and provide a thorough response. Additionally, email communication allows me to respond at a time that is convenient for me, ensuring that I can give thoughtful and accurate answers. Moreover, having a written record of the conversation helps both students and teachers to keep track of important information and refer back to it as needed.

In my experience as a teacher, I believe that asking questions in person is a better approach for addressing coursework and assignment-related problems. While email communication can be convenient, it lacks the immediate interaction and personal connection that face-to-face conversations provide. i believe in-person questions allow for real-time clarification, ensuring that students fully understand the topic at hand. Additionally, non-verbal cues, such as body language and facial expressions, can help gauge a student's level of comprehension. Moreover, direct interaction fosters a sense of engagement and encourages students to actively participate in their learning in the class.

I agree that people will read less in the future due to various factors. One reason is the rise of digital media. With the advent of e-books, online articles and social media platforms, people now have more options for consuming information and entertainment. Many people prefer to watch videos or listen to podcasts instead of reading traditional books or articles. 
Another factor is the decrease in attention spans. In today's fast-paced society, people have shorter attention spans and may find it more challenging to sit down and read for extended periods.
So overall, I think that while reading will always have its place, some changes in the social media suggest that people will read less in the future.

I respectfully disagree that people will read less in the future. While digital media and other forms of entertainment have gained popularity, reading continues to be a fundamental and timeless activity. Books, newspapers and magazines still hold a significant place in our society.
I think that reading offers unique benefits that cannot be replicated by other media. It enhances critical thinking, imagination and vocabulary skills. Moreover, many individuals find solace and relaxation in reading, making it an essential
part of their daily routine. In conclusion, despite the rise of digital media and changing habits, I believe that reading will remain a cherished activity.

I completely agree that university students should have part-time jobs. From my personal experience, I have found two significant advantages to this arrangement. Firstly, having a part-time job greatly enhances a student's time management skills. During my university years, I worked part-time as a tutor, which forced me to become more efficient with my time. Secondly, part-time jobs offer valuable networking opportunities. Through my job, I had the opportunity to interact with professionals in my field of interest. In conclusion, based on my personal experience, part-time jobs for university students not only improve time management skills but also provide networking opportunities that can be beneficial for their future career paths.

I disagree with the idea that university students should have part-time jobs. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, balancing work and studies can be overwhelming. When I worked part-time during my university years, I struggled to manage my time effectively, often compromising my academic performance. Secondly, having a part-time job limited my ability to engage in extracurricular activities and explore my interests. In conclusion, based on my personal experience, I believe that university students should prioritize their studies and personal development rather than taking on part-time jobs when they have so much on their plate during their university years.

I personally prefer spending time by myself. I feel this way for two reasons. One reason is that it allows me to have a sense of freedom and independence. When I am alone, I have the freedom to do whatever I want, without having to consider the preferences or needs of others. This gives me the opportunity to engage in activities that bring me joy and fulfillment, such as reading, writing, or practicing a hobby, such as coding. Moreover, spending time alone allows me to recharge and reflect on my thoughts and emotions. It provides me with a sense of peace and tranquility, enabling me to focus on self-care and my personal growth. For instance, I often use this time to meditate, journal, or set goals for myself. So, that’s why I prefer spending time by myself.

I prefer spending time with my family. I feel this way for two reasons. First, family gatherings and activities create lasting memories and strengthen the bond between us. For example, we often enjoy cooking and having meals together, which not only allows us to share delicious food but also fosters a sense of togetherness. Additionally, spending time with family provides an opportunity for open communication and emotional connection. We can share our thoughts, experiences, and challenges, and support each other through both happy and difficult times. Overall, being with my family brings me a sense of warmth, love, and a feeling of being part of something greater than myself.

I personally prefer working in an office for two main reasons. Firstly, working in an office provides a structured environment that promotes productivity and focus. Having a designated workspace and being surrounded by colleagues can create a sense of accountability and motivation. For instance, when I worked in an office, I found it easier to stay on task and collaborate with my team members. Secondly, being in an office allows for face-to-face interactions and socialization, which can foster better communication and teamwork. I vividly remember a time when a complex project required constant communication and coordination with my colleagues, and being physically present in the office greatly facilitated our collaboration.

For instance, I have the freedom to structure my day in a way that suits my personal needs and preferences, whether it's taking breaks to exercise or spending time with my family. Secondly, working from home can increase productivity and focus. For example, when I worked from home during a major project, I was able to work undisturbed and meet tight deadlines without the usual office distractions. Overall, the flexibility and increased focus that working from home provides have greatly improved my work experience as a freelancer.

Personally, I prefer to face challenges with the help of another person. I feel this way for two reasons. First, I think that having someone by my side provides emotional support, different perspectives, and shared responsibilities, and it makes the process more manageable and less overwhelming. For instance, when I had to organize a large event, I sought help from a friend who had experience in event planning. Additionally, during a challenging time in my life, I leaned on a close friend for support and guidance. Their presence and encouragement helped me navigate through the difficulties and find solutions. Overall, having another person's support and assistance can enhance problem-solving abilities and provide a sense of collaboration.

While I appreciate the benefits of having help from another person, I personally prefer facing challenges by myself. I find that tackling difficult situations on my own allows me to develop independence, resilience, and problem-solving skills. When I face challenges independently, I have the freedom to make my own decisions and learn from my mistakes without relying on others. It also gives me a sense of accomplishment and personal growth. For example, when I had to prepare for a major exam, I preferred studying alone as it allowed me to focus better and develop my own study strategies. Overall, facing challenges independently empowers me to take control of my own journey and build valuable skills along the way. So, that’s why I prefer facing challenges by myself.

I personally prefer listening to music on headphones while I'm on the go. It allows me to create my own personal soundtrack and enhances my overall experience. The headphones I use have noise-canceling features, which help me block out external distractions and immerse myself in the music. The high-quality sound and clarity of the headphones make the music more enjoyable and vibrant. Additionally, listening to music while commuting or traveling adds a sense of rhythm and energy to my day, making the journey more enjoyable. It's a personal preference that enhances my mood and adds an extra layer of enjoyment to my daily routine. So, that’s why I prefer listening to music on headphones.

I personally prefer going from place to place in silence. While I enjoy listening to music, I find that taking moments of silence during my commute or travels allows me to clear my mind and focus on my surroundings. It gives me the opportunity to observe and appreciate the environment, whether it's the sounds of nature or the hustle and bustle of city life. Silence also provides a chance for reflection and introspection, which can be beneficial for mental well-being. Additionally, without the distraction of music, I am more present in the moment and can fully engage in any conversations or interactions that may arise. Overall, the tranquility of silence during my journeys helps me find peace and allows me to be more mindful of my surroundings.

I agree with the statement that technology distances people from each other more than it brings them together. One example is the excessive use of social media platforms. While these platforms were initially designed to connect people, they often lead to isolation and superficial connections. Instead of having meaningful face-to-face interactions, people tend to rely on online communication, which lacks the depth of personal connection. Additionally, the constant use of smartphones and other devices can create a sense of detachment from the present moment, leading to reduced social interactions and increased feelings of loneliness. Overall, I think that technology has the potential to bring people together, but its overuse can often have the opposite effect.

I disagree with the statement that technology distances people from each other more than it brings them together. Technology has actually revolutionized communication by enabling people to connect across vast distances. Platforms like Skype, Zoom, and FaceTime have allowed individuals to have face-to-face conversations with friends and family members who live far away. Additionally, social media platforms, despite their limitations, have brought people from various parts of the world together to share interests and build communities. Online forums and groups provide platforms for individuals with niche hobbies or interests to connect and support each other, fostering a sense of togetherness. Technology has undoubtedly created new avenues for meaningful connections.

I would prefer a job that requires me to work mostly with computers and other technology. There are two main reasons for this preference. Firstly, I find that working with technology allows for greater efficiency and productivity. As someone who enjoys organizing and analyzing data, using technology enables me to process information quickly and accurately. Additionally, technology provides endless opportunities for learning and growth. For instance, in my previous job, I utilized various software programs to streamline workflows and enhance collaboration among team members. Overall, I believe that working with technology offers immense potential for innovation and personal development.

I would prefer a job that does not require me to work with much technology. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, I find that working without excessive reliance on technology allows for a more hands-on and tangible experience. I enjoy engaging in physical tasks and being directly involved in the process. For example, in my previous job, I loved the feeling of shaping wood with my hands and seeing the final product take form. Secondly, working in a non-technological job often offers a different level of human interaction and connection. For instance, as a teacher, I greatly value the direct interaction with students and the ability to guide and inspire them in person.

I agree that it is important for all university students to engage in social activities such as joining clubs or sports groups. Firstly, participating in these activities helps students develop a sense of community and belonging. For instance, when I joined a club related to my major, I met like-minded individuals who shared similar interests and goals. This not only provided a support system but also fostered friendships and networking opportunities. Secondly, engaging in social activities outside of academics promotes personal growth and development. When I joined a sports group, I not only improved my physical health but also learned valuable skills such as teamwork, discipline, and time management.

I disagree with the statement that it is important for all university students to engage in social activities such as joining clubs or sports groups. Firstly, not all students have the same interests or preferences. Some students may prefer to focus solely on their academics or have other commitments that take up their time. For example, as a university student, I had a heavy course load and also worked part-time to support myself financially. Engaging in social activities would have added unnecessary stress and detracted from my ability to succeed academically. Secondly, some students may be introverted or have social anxiety, making it uncomfortable or overwhelming for them to participate in large group activities.

I agree with the statement that newspapers are a better source of information about current news events than television. Firstly, newspapers provide in-depth and detailed coverage of news stories. Unlike television, which often presents brief and summarized segments, newspapers allow for comprehensive reporting, analysis, and background information. For instance, when I wanted to understand the complexities of a political issue, I found that newspaper articles provided a more thorough understanding compared to the limited coverage on television news. Secondly, newspapers offer a wider range of perspectives and opinions. I appreciate this diversity as it helps me develop a well-rounded understanding of current events.

I respectfully disagree with the statement that newspapers are a better source of information about current news events than television. Firstly, television provides immediate and live coverage of breaking news events. When major incidents occur, such as natural disasters or political developments, television networks are often the first to report and provide real-time updates. For instance, during a recent hurricane, I relied on television news for live footage, interviews, and expert analysis, which helped me stay informed about the situation. Secondly, television offers visual storytelling that can enhance understanding and engagement. News programs often use graphics, videos, and interviews to provide a comprehensive view of events.

Personally, I would prefer the traditional office setting over working from home. Firstly, the office environment provides a structured and professional atmosphere that helps me stay focused and motivated. Being surrounded by colleagues and the buzz of work activities creates a sense of accountability and productivity. Additionally, the office allows for better collaboration and networking opportunities. Face-to-face interactions with colleagues facilitate effective communication, brainstorming sessions, and mutual support. For instance, in my previous job, being physically present in the office allowed me to have impromptu discussions with team members, which often led to innovative ideas and solutions. So, that’s why I prefer the office setting.

I would prefer to work from home rather than in an office setting. Firstly, working from home allows for a flexible schedule, enabling me to manage my time efficiently. For example, I can start my workday earlier or later depending on my personal preferences, allowing me to optimize my productivity. Additionally, working from home eliminates the need for a daily commute, which can be time-consuming and stressful. Instead of spending hours in traffic or crowded public transportation, I can utilize that time for personal development or relaxation. For instance, I can use the saved commute time to exercise or engage in a hobby that helps me unwind. Overall, the freedom and convenience that working from home offers make it the ideal work arrangement for me.

I would definitely go for taking classes during summer. I feel this way for two reasons. First, I think that taking summer classes helps students to stay engaged with academic material. Personally, I took a summer math class during my college years, and I found that it helped me maintain my mathematical skills and stay mentally sharp. Another advantage of taking summer classes is the opportunity to lighten the course load during the regular academic year. This can reduce stress levels and allow for a better work-life balance.

It allowed me to engage in activities I enjoyed, spend time with loved ones, and return to school feeling refreshed and ready to tackle new challenges. Second, taking the summer off provides the opportunity to gain work experience or earn money. For instance, I took a summer off to work as an intern at a company. This experience not only provided me with practical skills and knowledge in my field but also helped me build my professional network.

I agree with the statement that it is important for a child's development to spend short periods of time living away from home and visiting other relatives or friends. Firstly, it allows children to develop independence and adaptability. For example, staying with grandparents for a weekend can teach a child how to adjust to different rules and expectations. Secondly, it broadens their social and cultural experiences. By spending time with relatives or friends in different locations, children can learn about different traditions, customs, and perspectives. This exposure helps them develop empathy, tolerance, and a broader worldview. For instance, visiting a friend's house in a different city can expose a child to different lifestyles and cultural practices.

I disagree with the statement that it is important for a child's development to spend short periods of time living away from home and visiting other relatives or friends. Firstly, children need a stable and familiar environment to develop a sense of security and stability. Constantly moving or staying in different places may disrupt their routine and hinder their emotional well-being. For example, frequent visits to different relatives' houses can be overwhelming for a child and may cause anxiety or stress. Secondly, spending time away from home can limit the child's ability to build strong relationships and social support networks within their immediate family. Regular interactions and bonding with parents and siblings are crucial for a child's emotional development and attachment.

I personally prefer to buy used books, for a couple of reasons. Firstly, used books are often more affordable than new ones. As a student, I have a limited budget, and buying used books allows me to save money. For example, I recently purchased a used textbook for half the price of a new one, which made a significant difference in my expenses. Secondly, used books have a sense of character and history that I find appealing. I enjoy flipping through the pages and imagining the previous owners who might have read and annotated them. It adds a unique charm to the reading experience. I remember finding a used novel with notes in the margins, and it made me feel connected to the previous reader and their thoughts.

I prefer to buy new books for a couple of reasons. Firstly, new books offer a sense of freshness and pristine condition that I find appealing. Opening a brand new book and being the first one to read it gives me a sense of excitement and anticipation. It's like embarking on a new adventure with every page turn. For instance, I recently bought a new novel by my favorite author, and the crisp pages and untouched cover made the reading experience even more enjoyable. Secondly, new books often come with additional features or bonus content. They may include author interviews, exclusive illustrations, or bonus chapters that provide deeper insights into the story. Having access to these extra materials enhances my reading experience.

I completely disagree with the statement that popular celebrities are good examples for young people to follow. There are two main reasons for this perspective. Firstly, celebrities often lead lifestyles that are unrealistic and unattainable for the average person. For instance, the lavish lifestyles portrayed by some reality TV stars may give young people unrealistic expectations and a skewed sense of what is truly important in life. Secondly, celebrities are not always the best role models when it comes to moral values and behavior. Many celebrities have been involved in scandals, legal issues, and unhealthy habits. Young people may be influenced by these negative behaviors and adopt them as norms.

I completely agree that popular celebrities can be good examples for young people to follow. There are two primary reasons for this. Firstly, celebrities often demonstrate hard work and perseverance, which are essential qualities for success. For example, the musician Beyoncé is known for her incredible work ethic and dedication to her craft. This can inspire young people to work hard and strive for excellence in their own pursuits. Secondly, celebrities often use their platform to raise awareness about important social issues and make a positive impact on society. Take the actor and activist Leonardo DiCaprio as an example. He is actively involved in environmental conservation efforts.

I agree with the statement that schools that encourage students to be creative and use their imagination produce the most successful students. Firstly, when students are encouraged to think outside the box and explore different possibilities, they develop the ability to approach challenges from multiple perspectives. Personally, I attended a school that prioritized creativity, and I found that it enhanced my problem-solving abilities and allowed me to come up with innovative solutions. Secondly, creativity nurtures self-expression and confidence. This confidence translates into greater success in various endeavors, such as presentations, teamwork, and leadership roles.

I disagree with the statement that schools that encourage students to be creative and use their imagination produce the most successful students. While creativity is an important skill, it is not the sole determinant of success. Firstly, success in academic and professional settings often requires a strong foundation of knowledge and skills in specific subjects. For example, in fields like medicine or engineering, students need a solid understanding of fundamental concepts and rigorous training, which may not be solely fostered through creativity. Secondly, success is subjective and different individuals have different strengths and talents, and success can be achieved through a combination of various skills.

I personally think when meeting new people, our initial observations can provide valuable insights about them, indicating certain aspects of their personality and character. These first impressions can indeed tell us a lot about a person for two main reasons. Firstly, non-verbal cues such as body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice can reveal a person's emotional state and level of confidence. Secondly, the initial conversations and interactions with a person can provide glimpses into their interests, values, and communication style. While these initial observations can be valuable, it is important to note that forming a comprehensive understanding of a person takes time and further interaction.

I personally think that when meeting new people, our initial observations can provide some insights into their personality or behavior, but they do not necessarily tell us a lot about the person. It takes time and further interactions to truly understand someone's character. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, initial observations may be biased or misleading. For instance, someone may appear shy or reserved during the first interaction, but as we get to know them better, we realize that they are actually outgoing and friendly. Secondly, people often put on a façade when meeting new individuals, trying to impress or hide certain aspects of their personality. To truly understand a person, one needs to spend more time with them.

In my opinion, spending a lot of money on a vacation can be better for two main reasons. Firstly, it allows for a higher level of comfort and luxury during the trip. By investing in higher quality accommodations, transportation, and dining experiences, one can truly relax and indulge in their vacation, creating lasting memories. Secondly, spending more money often opens up opportunities for unique and exclusive activities or attractions that may not be accessible to those on a budget. For instance, I once spent a lot of money on a luxury cruise that took me to remote islands, giving me the chance to explore untouched natural beauty and engage in once-in-a-lifetime experiences like swimming with dolphins.

In my opinion, spending very little money on a vacation can be better for two main reasons. Firstly, it allows for a sense of adventure and spontaneity. When you have a limited budget, you are often forced to be creative with your travel plans, seeking out cheaper accommodations, local transportation, and affordable activities. This can lead to unexpected discoveries and a more authentic experience of the destination. Secondly, spending less money on a vacation can provide financial peace of mind. By being mindful of expenses and budgeting wisely, you can avoid the stress and worry that can come with overspending. Personally, I once took a budget-friendly backpacking trip through Europe.Despite the low cost, I had an incredible time.

In my opinion, participating in clubs or activities in addition to doing schoolwork is better for two main reasons. Firstly, it allows students to develop a well-rounded skill set and gain valuable experiences beyond the classroom. For example, I joined a photography club in university alongside my studies. Through this club, I learned new photography techniques, collaborated with peers, and even had the opportunity to exhibit my work. These experiences enhanced my creativity and interpersonal skills, which have proven beneficial in various aspects of my life. Secondly, participating in clubs or activities fosters a sense of community and connection with like-minded individuals. So, that’s why I would go for participating in clubs or activities alongside schoolwork.

I personally prefer not to participate in clubs or activities when doing schoolwork. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, it allows students to prioritize their academic goals and focus on their studies. For instance, during my time in university, I dedicated most of my time to schoolwork as I aimed to maintain a high GPA and excel in my classes. This intense focus on my studies allowed me to fully immerse myself in my coursework and achieve academic success. Secondly, not participating in extra activities can provide more time for self-care and relaxation. By prioritizing rest and downtime, students can prevent burnout and maintain their mental and physical well-being. So, that’s why I do not overcommit myself to activities outside of school.

Personally, I prefer having friends drop by for an unplanned or surprise visit for two reasons. Firstly, it adds an element of spontaneity and excitement to my day. When a friend unexpectedly shows up, it breaks the monotony and brings a sense of joy and surprise. For instance, I remember a time when a close friend dropped by unannounced with a homemade dessert. It instantly lifted my spirits and made the day more memorable. Secondly, it allows for more genuine and relaxed interactions. With planned visits, there is often pressure to prepare and create a perfect environment. However, when friends drop by unexpectedly, there is no time for pretense or overthinking.

I prefer that friends let me know in advance before coming to visit for two reasons. Firstly, knowing in advance allows me to plan and prepare for their visit. I can ensure that I have enough time to tidy up my living space, make sure I have refreshments available, and prioritize my schedule accordingly. For instance, when a friend informs me ahead of time, I can allocate time to catch up and give them my undivided attention. Secondly, advanced notice gives me the opportunity to mentally and emotionally prepare for social interactions. As an introvert, sudden visits can sometimes catch me off guard and leave me feeling overwhelmed. Having a heads-up allows me to mentally prepare for socializing and ensure that I am in the right mindset.

I agree with the statement that good luck is as important as hard work in achieving success in a person's career. Firstly, luck can present unexpected opportunities that can propel a person's career forward. For instance, someone might happen to meet a key contact or stumble upon a unique opportunity purely by chance. Secondly, luck can influence external circumstances that impact career success. Being in the right place at the right time can make a significant difference.

I disagree with the statement that good luck is as important as hard work in achieving success in a person's career. Firstly, hard work is a controllable factor that individuals can actively pursue. By putting in consistent effort, setting goals, and acquiring the necessary skills, one can increase their chances of success. Secondly, success is often the result of consistent hard work over time. It is the accumulation of knowledge, experience, and expertise that positions individuals for success. In my own experience, I have seen colleagues who relied solely on luck without putting in the necessary effort. So, that’s why I do not see luck as a primary factor in gaining success.

I agree with the statement that good teachers should admit when they have made a mistake or do not know something. Firstly, admitting mistakes and lack of knowledge demonstrates humility, which is an essential quality for educators. So, teachers show that they are open to learning from their students. Secondly, admitting mistakes and not knowing something can serve as valuable teaching moments. It teaches students that it is all right to make errors and that seeking knowledge is a continuous process. Personally, I have had teachers who openly admitted when they were wrong or unsure about a topic. This made the classroom environment more collaborative and encouraged deeper discussions where we collectively sought to find answers.

While it may seem counterintuitive, I partially disagree with the statement that good teachers should admit when they have made a mistake or do not know something. Firstly, admitting mistakes or lack of knowledge might reduce students' confidence in the teacher's abilities. Students often look to their teachers as knowledgeable experts, and acknowledging errors could undermine this perception. Secondly, as a personal experience, I've observed that teachers who confidently provide accurate information tend to inspire students more effectively. Repeatedly admitting a lack of knowledge can diminish students' respect and trust in the teacher's expertise.

I agree with the theory that giving employees extra free time during the workday to socialize or engage in non-work activities can increase productivity. Firstly, when individuals have a chance to relax and connect with others, it reduces stress levels and creates a positive work environment. For example, in my previous workplace, we had designated break areas where employees could interact and recharge, resulting in improved teamwork and motivation. Secondly, allowing time for non-work activities can enhance creativity and problem-solving skills. When employees have opportunities to pursue their passions or engage in activities unrelated to work, it opens up new perspectives and fosters innovative thinking.

I don't fully agree with the theory that providing employees with extra free time during the workday to socialize or engage in non-work activities will increase productivity. Firstly, excessive free time can lead to distractions and reduced focus. For instance, in my previous workplace, we had flexible schedules that allowed for excessive socializing, which often resulted in decreased output. Secondly, not all employees may have the same preferences or interests when it comes to non-work activities. While some individuals may benefit from socializing during breaks, others may prefer using their time in more focused ways to accomplish tasks. Therefore, a one-size-fits-all approach to providing free time may not be effective.

I believe that universities should feature a variety of speakers, regardless of their opinions. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, by inviting speakers with controversial opinions, universities promote intellectual growth and the ability to analyze different viewpoints. For instance, during my time at university, we had a speaker with controversial views on climate change. Although some students disagreed with the speaker, it stimulated vibrant discussions and allowed us to evaluate various arguments. Secondly, restricting certain speakers based on their opinions can limit intellectual freedom and hinder the pursuit of knowledge. Encouraging a wide range of perspectives fosters an inclusive and enriching learning environment.

I don't fully agree with the idea that universities should necessarily feature a variety of speakers, regardless of their opinions. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, I think that inviting speakers with controversial opinions can create a hostile or uncomfortable atmosphere for some students. Universities have a responsibility to provide a safe and inclusive environment that promotes learning and respect. Secondly, universities should ensure that guest speakers bring valuable and evidence-based insights. Inviting speakers solely for the sake of controversy may undermine the academic integrity and reputation of the institution. For instance, if a speaker promotes hate speech, it's essential for the university to prioritize the well-being of its students and uphold its values.

            Imagine that you live in a crowded city with only one green space-the city park. To address the issue of overcrowding the city council has proposed building a new housing complex on this last space in the city center. Do you think this is a good idea? Explain why or why not

I believe that building a new housing complex on the only green space in a crowded city center would have detrimental effects. I feel this way for two reasons. First, I think the city park serves as a vital oasis of nature, providing residents with a place to relax, exercise, and connect with the natural environment. Second, green spaces play a crucial role in mitigating air pollution, regulating temperature, and promoting biodiversity. By eliminating the city park, the urban heat island effect could worsen, air quality may decline, and wildlife habitats would be disrupted. These environmental consequences would negatively impact the overall sustainability and livability of the city. So, that’s why I think it’s not a good idea.

While I understand the importance of green spaces in the city, I think it would be a good idea to build a new housing complex in the city park. I feel this way for two reasons. First, if the city is facing a shortage of housing, constructing a new housing complex in the city center can provide much-needed residential units. Second, cities often face limited land availability, especially in crowded areas. Repurposing the city park as a housing complex maximizes the utilization of urban space. This can lead to more efficient land use, increased density, and the potential for mixed-use development that includes residential, commercial, and recreational facilities.

I agree with the statement that for a business to be successful nowadays, it must be actively involved in social media. I feel this way for two reasons: First, I think social media provides a platform to reach a large and diverse audience. By establishing a strong online presence, businesses can connect with potential customers, increase brand visibility, and expand their market reach. For example, a large bakery that actively shares mouth-watering photos and engaging content on Instagram can attract new customers from different locations. Second, social media allows businesses to engage directly with their audience, build customer relationships, and receive valuable feedback.

While I understand the importance of social media in business growth, I believe there are valid arguments against it. First, not all businesses cater to a demographic that heavily relies on social media. Some industries, like specialized business-to-business services or niche markets, may find more success by focusing their resources on other marketing strategies that directly reach their target audience. Second, maintaining an active presence on social media requires dedicated time, effort, and skilled personnel. Small businesses with limited resources may struggle to effectively manage social media platforms. Allocating resources to activities aligned with their business model can contribute more directly to their success.

I believe that businesses should be required to spend a certain amount of their profits on social programs that benefit the public and the communities where they operate. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, businesses often rely on the support and resources provided by the communities in which they operate. It is only fair that businesses give back and invest in initiatives that improve the well-being of the community. Secondly, investing in social programs can have long-term benefits for businesses themselves. By addressing social issues such as education, healthcare, or environmental sustainability, businesses can create a more stable and prosperous community.

While I cannot deny the benefits of community for businesses, I do not believe businesses should spend a certain amount of money on social programs that benefit the public and the communities where they operate. I feel this way for two reasons. First, I think that businesses should have the freedom to decide how to allocate their profits based on market forces and individual choice. I believe determining how profits are spent can hinder economic growth and discourage entrepreneurship. Second, businesses may not have the necessary resources or expertise to effectively address social issues. It is more efficient for businesses to focus on their core operations and generate profits, allowing them to contribute indirectly through job creation and tax payments.

I agree with the statement that it is better for students to live with a roommate who is studying the same subject. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, living with a roommate who is studying the same subject can create a conducive learning environment. Roommates with shared academic interests can engage in discussions, exchange ideas, and provide valuable insights into the coursework. This collaboration can enhance understanding, motivation, and overall academic performance. Secondly, living with a roommate who is studying the same subject can foster a sense of support. Facing the challenges of a particular subject together can create a bond. Roommates can help each other with assignments, study for exams, and provide emotional support during stressful times.

I disagree with the statement that it is better for students to live with a roommate who is studying the same subject. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, living with a roommate who is studying a different subject can broaden one's perspective. Interacting with someone from a different academic background exposes students to new ideas, knowledge, and ways of thinking. This diversity can lead to intellectual growth and a more well-rounded education. Secondly, living with a roommate who is studying a different subject can promote personal growth and skill development. Engaging in conversations and activities outside of one's own field of study can enhance critical thinking, communication, and problem-solving abilities.

I agree with the notion that some recent university graduates should choose to spend a period of time doing volunteer or community service before starting their careers. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, volunteering allows graduates to gain valuable practical experience and develop essential skills. This hands-on experience can make them more competitive in the job market and provide them with a deeper understanding of social issues.

I agree with the perspective that it is better for recent university graduates to start working as soon as possible after graduation. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, starting work immediately allows graduates to gain relevant industry experience and begin building their professional network. By entering the workforce promptly, they can apply their academic knowledge in a practical setting and develop the specific skills required in their chosen field. Secondly, starting work sooner enables graduates to start earning a steady income and become financially independent. Many graduates may have student loans or other financial responsibilities to handle, and securing a job quickly can help alleviate financial stress.

I agree with the theory that providing employees with extra free time during the workday to socialize or engage in non-work activities can increase productivity. I feel this way for two reasons. First, allowing employees to take breaks for socializing or pursuing non-work activities can stimulate their creative thinking. Taking a step back from work-related tasks can provide fresh perspectives and allow for innovative ideas to emerge. Second, offering employees time for socializing or non-work activities promotes a healthier work-life balance. When employees have the opportunity to socialize and relax during the workday, they are more likely to feel motivated, less stressed, and more satisfied with their job.

I respectfully disagree with the idea of giving employees extra free time during the workday for non-work activities. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, it may lead to a decrease in productivity rather than an increase. Employees may become too relaxed and find it difficult to refocus on work tasks after engaging in non-work activities. Secondly, it could create a sense of unfairness among employees who do not have the same amount of free time due to their workload or job responsibilities. This could lead to a negative work environment and decreased morale. Instead, companies should focus on implementing effective time management strategies and promoting work-life balance outside of working hours to ensure productivity.

Personally, I find great value in re-reading certain books multiple times. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, revisiting a book allows me to uncover new layers of meaning and gain a deeper understanding of the author's intentions.

I personally prefer to always read something I have never read before. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, exploring new books exposes me to a diverse range of ideas, perspectives, and writing styles. It broadens my horizons and enhances my understanding of the world. For instance, reading Haruki Murakami's "Norwegian Wood" introduced me to the complexities of human relationships and the exploration of grief and loss in a profound and introspective manner. Secondly, discovering new books brings a sense of excitement and anticipation. The thrill of embarking on a literary adventure, not knowing what awaits me, is exciting. Each new book is a different adventure.

It is their choice to become part of the community, and they should actively engage in building relationships and participating in community activities. Secondly, communities are dynamic and ever-changing. People move in and out of neighborhoods frequently, and it is unrealistic to expect existing residents to constantly prioritize making newcomers feel welcome.

When it comes to watching movies and television shows with friends and family, I strongly prefer that everyone remains quiet until the end. There are two reasons for this preference, both based on personal experiences. Firstly, maintaining silence allows for complete immersion in the storyline and the cinematic experience. I have often found myself captivated by a film's twists and turns, only to have the immersion shattered by constant chatter, disrupting the flow and diluting the overall enjoyment. Secondly, silence during viewing enables meaningful discussions afterward. By saving opinions and thoughts until the end, we create space for engaging conversations about the movie's themes, character development, and artistic choices.

When it comes to watching movies and television shows with friends and family, I personally enjoy an environment where everyone can freely share their opinions and thoughts during the viewing experience. There are two reasons why I prefer this interactive approach. Firstly, discussing the movie in real-time allows for immediate engagement and enhances overall enjoyment. For instance, I vividly remember watching a suspenseful thriller with friends and engaging in lively debates about the identity of the culprit. Secondly, exchanging opinions during the movie provides different perspectives and insights. Each person brings their unique observations and interpretations to the table, enriching the viewing experience.

I agree with the statement that older doctors are more knowledgeable than younger doctors. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, older doctors have had the opportunity to accumulate years of experience in their respective fields. Through their extensive practice, they have encountered a wide range of medical cases and have developed a deep understanding of various conditions and treatments. Secondly, older doctors often possess a vast network of professional connections. Over the course of their careers, they have built relationships with colleagues, specialists, and researchers. This network provides them with access to the latest medical advancements, research findings, and emerging treatment options.

I respectfully disagree with the statement that older doctors are more knowledgeable than younger doctors. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, advancements in medical research and technology are occurring at a rapid pace. Younger doctors, fresh out of medical school, have been exposed to the latest evidence-based practices and cutting-edge technologies. They are well-versed in the most recent medical developments and can apply them to patient care. Secondly, younger doctors often possess a stronger foundation in medical education due to advancements in curriculum and teaching methods. They have benefited from updated and comprehensive training programs that incorporate the latest research and clinical guidelines.

I strongly agree that children should be encouraged to watch or listen to the news from an early age. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, it helps children to develop a broader understanding of the world around them. By being exposed to different news topics, they learn about current events, diverse cultures, and global issues. For example, when I was a child, watching the news helped me to understand the significance of environmental conservation and motivated me to take action. Secondly, it enhances critical thinking skills. News exposes children to different perspectives and encourages them to question and analyze information. This helps them develop a well-rounded and informed opinion on various matters.

I respectfully disagree with the statement that children should be encouraged to watch or listen to the news from an early age. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, the news often contains disturbing or violent content that can be emotionally overwhelming for young children. For instance, when I was a child, witnessing news reports about natural disasters or acts of terrorism caused anxiety and fear. Secondly, the news can be biased and present a limited perspective on complex issues. Children may not possess the critical thinking skills necessary to differentiate between fact and opinion. As a result, they may develop misconceptions.

I personally prefer having a teacher who supervises me closely and frequently checks my work. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, regular supervision ensures that I stay on track and meet the learning objectives. When a teacher closely monitors my progress, they can identify any misunderstandings or gaps in knowledge. For instance, in my math class, my teacher's close supervision helped me identify and correct my mistakes early on, leading to improved understanding and better grades. Secondly, frequent checks by a teacher provide valuable feedback and motivation. When my work is regularly evaluated, I receive timely feedback on my strengths and areas for improvement.

I personally prefer having a teacher who lets me work on my own and only occasionally checks my work. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, this approach encourages independent thinking and problem-solving skills. When given the freedom to explore and find solutions on my own, I develop a sense of autonomy and become more resourceful. For example, in my science class, my teacher allowed us to conduct experiments individually, fostering creativity and critical thinking. Secondly, occasional checks provide a balance between guidance and self-discovery. It allows me to take ownership of my learning while still receiving valuable feedback when needed.

I strongly agree with the statement that children should be required to help with household tasks as soon as they are old enough to do so. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, involving children in household tasks instills a sense of responsibility and work ethic. For instance, I started assisting with setting the table for meals at a young age, which taught me the value of teamwork and the satisfaction of completing a task. Secondly, participating in household chores promotes independence and self-sufficiency. As children actively engage in tasks, they acquire essential life skills that will serve them well in adulthood.

I respectfully disagree with the statement that children should be required to help with household tasks as soon as they are old enough to do so. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, young children require a nurturing and supportive environment that prioritizes their education and play. Pushing them into extensive household tasks might hinder their cognitive and social development. For instance, I vividly recall struggling with balancing schoolwork and chores as a child, which often left me overwhelmed and stressed. Secondly, children should be allowed to enjoy their childhood and engage in age-appropriate activities. Overburdening them with household tasks might deprive them of important experiences.

I respectfully disagree with the statement that the government should enact a law to fine people who use cell phones while walking across the street. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, it is challenging to enforce such a law effectively. This could lead to potential misuse or unfair targeting by law enforcement. Secondly, education and awareness campaigns can be more impactful in promoting responsible behavior. Instead of resorting to fines, investing in public education about the dangers of distracted walking and encouraging responsible cellphone use could be more effective in changing behavior. So, that’s why I disagree with the statement.

I agree with the statement that the government should enact a law to fine people who use cell phones while walking across the street. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, distracted walking poses a significant risk to individuals and others around them. Using cell phones while crossing a street diverts attention from the surroundings, increasing the likelihood of accidents. Secondly, fines would promote responsible behavior and discourage dangerous habits. By imposing penalties, the government sends a clear message that distracted walking is not acceptable. Similar legislation has been effective in curbing other risky behaviors, such as texting while driving. So, that’s why I disagree with this statement.

Personally, I prefer to spend my extra money on objects rather than experiences. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, objects provide long-term utility and functionality. For instance, investing in a high-quality laptop allows me to enhance my productivity, whether for work or personal projects. In contrast, experiences like vacations or concerts are temporary and fleeting, but lacking ongoing practicality. Secondly, objects can hold sentimental value and create lasting memories. A cherished item, such as a piece of jewelry, serves as a reminder of significant milestones or loved ones. These objects evoke emotions and memories every time they are seen or used.

I strongly believe that spending extra money on experiences rather than objects is a wise choice. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, experiences have a lasting impact on our lives. While material possessions may lose their novelty over time, memories of a thrilling adventure or an unforgettable concert can bring joy and fulfillment for years to come. Secondly, experiences foster personal growth and broaden our horizons. Traveling to new places or attending cultural events exposes us to different perspectives, cultures, and ways of life, helping us develop empathy and understanding. So, that’s why I believe spending extra money on experiences is worth it.

I believe that governments should allocate funds to support arts institutions such as museums or theaters. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, arts institutions play a crucial role in preserving cultural heritage and promoting creativity. By supporting arts institutions financially, governments ensure the preservation and accessibility of our cultural heritage. Secondly, arts institutions contribute to local economies and tourism. Museums and theaters attract visitors from near and far, who spend money on tickets, accommodations, dining, and other local businesses, which in turn creates jobs and generates revenue.

I hold the opinion that it is not the role of governments to provide financial support to arts institutions like museums or theaters. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, limited resources should be directed towards sectors that directly benefit the well-being and development of the population as a whole. While arts institutions have their merits, they are not fundamental necessities that require public funding. Secondly, relying on government funding can stifle creativity and innovation within the arts industry. By depending on state support, arts institutions may become complacent and reliant on others, diminishing their motivation to seek funding sources.

I agree that homework might not be as helpful for younger children and should be primarily assigned to older students. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, younger children need ample time for unstructured play and exploration, which aids in their cognitive and social development. Excessive homework can impede these crucial activities. For instance, my cousin, who is in second grade, often struggles to complete his homework, leaving him with little time to engage in creative play. Secondly, older students are better equipped to handle the responsibilities and time management skills required for homework. They have developed stronger study skills and can benefit from additional practice and independent learning.

I believe that homework can be beneficial for children of all ages. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, homework helps develop important skills such as time management, self-discipline, and responsibility. By assigning age-appropriate tasks, younger children can learn to organize their time effectively and develop a sense of accountability. For instance, when I was in elementary school, I had homework assignments that involved reading, practicing math problems, and completing creative projects. These tasks helped me learn how to manage my time and set priorities. Secondly, homework fosters a connection between home and school, allowing parents to be involved in their child's education. This collaboration strengthens the child's understanding.

I agree that it is important for all young people to learn domestic skills such as cooking, sewing, and caring for children. I feel this way for one reason. I believe that these skills foster self-sufficiency and independence. Knowing how to cook allows individuals to prepare nutritious meals for themselves, promoting a healthy lifestyle. Sewing skills enable them to mend clothes or even create new ones. Additionally, learning to care for children prepares young people for future roles as parents or caregivers. Personally, I have found that knowing how to cook has allowed me to eat well-balanced meals even when dining options are limited. Overall, domestic skills empower individuals.

I respectfully disagree with the statement that it is important for all young people to learn domestic skills such as cooking, sewing, and caring for children. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, individuals have diverse interests and talents, and forcing everyone to learn these skills may overlook their unique passions and their potential. For example, some individuals may excel in areas like technology, art, or sports, and dedicating time to their chosen pursuits can lead to greater personal fulfillment and success. Secondly, in today's interconnected world, there are ample resources available for outsourcing domestic tasks. So, I think that cultivating individual talents can lead to a more innovative society.

I agree with the statement that fewer people are taking the time to read books for pleasure due to the increasing popularity of entertainment technology. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, entertainment technology offers a wide range of captivating options that compete for people's attention. For example, I've noticed that my own reading habits have diminished as I find myself engrossed in binge-watching TV shows or playing immersive video games. Secondly, technology provides instant gratification and quick stimulation, whereas reading books requires patience and active imagination.

I respectfully disagree with the statement that the increasing popularity of entertainment technology leads to fewer people reading books for pleasure. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, technology has also brought about new avenues for reading, such as e-books and audiobooks, which have made literature more accessible and convenient. Personally, I have found myself reading more books through digital platforms, taking advantage of the ease of carrying multiple books in one device. Secondly, the rise of social media and online communities has actually sparked a renewed interest in reading and book discussions.

I personally prefer to work in a company where I have the independence to work out solutions to problems on my own. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, when I have the freedom to make decisions and find solutions independently, I feel more motivated and empowered. For example, in a previous role, I was given the freedom to design and implement a new project management system. Being able to work autonomously allowed me to tailor the system to our specific needs and be proud of the successful results. Secondly, autonomy fosters creativity and innovation. When I am not restricted by rigid guidelines, I can explore different approaches and think outside the box. So, that’s why I prefer to work out solutions on my own.

I personally prefer to work in an environment where I am told exactly what I need to do. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, when I have a clear understanding of my tasks and expectations, it allows me to focus on execution rather than spending time figuring out the next steps. For instance, in my previous job, I appreciated receiving detailed project briefs that outlined the objectives and timelines. Secondly, when there are specific guidelines and protocols to follow, it minimizes the chances of making mistakes or deviating from the intended path. This is especially crucial when working on complex projects with strict compliance requirements.

Firstly, being part of a performance allows me to actively engage with the art form. Whether it's acting in a play or playing an instrument in a concert, I feel a sense of fulfillment and accomplishment when I contribute to the overall experience.

When it comes to watching movies and television shows with friends and family, I strongly prefer that everyone remains quiet until the end. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, maintaining silence allows for complete immersion in the storyline and the cinematic experience. When everyone refrains from talking, it creates an atmosphere of focus and concentration. This enables us to fully appreciate the nuances of the plot. Secondly, being quiet during a movie or show respects the work of the filmmakers and the efforts put into creating the production. By remaining silent, we show appreciation for their hard work and dedication. We acknowledge their efforts and allowing their work to be fully appreciated.

It allows for a lively exchange of ideas, interpretations, and reactions. Secondly, talking during the viewing process can create a more interactive and social atmosphere. It encourages active participation and involvement, making the experience more dynamic and enjoyable. So, that’s why I prefer the talking over silence during movies.

I believe that universities expecting students to choose a major field of study when they enter university is the better option. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, early selection of a major field of study provides students with a clear academic direction from the beginning. It allows them to focus their efforts and resources on courses and experiences directly related to their chosen field. Secondly, early major selection enables students to make informed decisions about their academic and career paths. By committing to a major early on, students can take advantage of the university's resources and support systems tailored to their specific field, which maximizes their learning and growth.

I believe that universities allowing students to wait until the second or third year before deciding on a major field is the better option. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, delaying the decision on a major allows students to explore a variety of subjects and disciplines. It gives them the opportunity to take a range of introductory courses and discover their true interests and passions. Secondly, delaying the choice of a major provides flexibility and adaptability. Many students enter university with limited exposure to different fields of study. By allowing them to wait, universities acknowledge that personal and academic growth can occur during the initial years of college.

I agree that every college student should be required to take math classes, regardless of their future careers. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, math cultivates critical thinking and problem-solving abilities that are essential in any profession. For instance, as a computer science major, I initially deemed math irrelevant. However, I soon realized its significance in developing logical reasoning and algorithmic thinking. Secondly, math provides a universal language for communication and collaboration. In interdisciplinary projects, understanding mathematical concepts enables effective collaboration and enhances communication.

I agree that only college students who need math in their future careers should be required to study it. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, teaching math to everyone could lead to demotivation and disengagement for those who have no interest in the subject. For example, as an English literature major, I struggled with math and found it challenging to stay engaged in the material that felt unrelated to my career goals. Secondly, students have diverse career aspirations, and their time and energy would be better spent focusing on subjects directly relevant to their chosen fields. By allowing students to choose math based on their career needs, they can allocate more time and effort to developing expertise in their field.

In my opinion, resorting to extreme methods, such as surgery, solely to change one's appearance is not a good idea. While personal choices regarding appearance should be respected, there are several reasons why I disagree with the use of such methods. Firstly, altering one's appearance through surgery carries inherent risks and potential complications, both physically and psychologically. The pursuit of an idealized image of beauty should not come at the expense of one's health and well-being. Secondly, focusing solely on external appearances can perpetuate unrealistic beauty standards and undermine self-acceptance and confidence.

In my perspective, the fact that some individuals choose to use extreme methods, including surgery, to alter their appearance in order to feel more attractive is a good idea. I feel this way for a reason. People have the autonomy to make decisions about their bodies, and if changing their appearance brings them confidence and happiness, it can be seen as a positive choice. For some individuals, physical changes can boost self-esteem and improve their overall well-being. Furthermore, It's important to recognize that everyone has unique reasons for wanting to change their appearance, and their choices should be respected. Ultimately, the decision to utilize these is a personal one.

I agree with the statement that a boss or manager should not form close friendships with their employees. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, maintaining a professional boundary ensures objectivity and fairness in decision-making. When a boss becomes friends with their subordinates, it becomes increasingly challenging to make impartial judgments. Secondly, it is essential to maintain a level of authority and respect in a managerial role. Close friendships can blur the lines of authority, leading to a lack of discipline and professionalism among employees. So, that’s why I agree with this statement.

I disagree with the statement that a boss or manager should not form close friendships with their employees. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, a strong bond between a boss and employees fosters trust and open communication. When employees feel comfortable with their manager, they are more likely to share concerns, ideas, and feedback. Secondly, friendships at work can enhance employee satisfaction and engagement. When a boss shows genuine care and interest in their employees' well-being, it creates a positive and supportive atmosphere. Personal connections can also lead to increased job satisfaction and loyalty, resulting in higher retention rates.

Firstly, being within walking distance means saving precious time and energy that would otherwise be spent commuting. It becomes easier to attend classes, access resources, and participate in extracurricular activities. Secondly, the convenience of living close to campus promotes a healthier lifestyle.

Firstly, the housing complex would address the issue of overcrowding in the city. By utilizing the available green space, the city council can provide much-needed housing options in a centralized location. Secondly, the housing complex can incorporate green design elements, such as rooftop gardens or other green spaces, to compensate for the loss of the city park. These green features would contribute to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly living environment.

I personally think that building a new housing complex on the last green space in the city center is not a good idea. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, the city park serves as the only green oasis in a crowded city, providing vital benefits to the residents. It offers a space for relaxation, recreation, and physical activity, which are essential for the well-being of urban people. Removing the park would deprive the community of a valuable resource and negatively impact their quality of life. Secondly, green spaces play a crucial role in mitigating environmental issues.

I personally think that requiring first-year students to take a class on utilizing university library resources and writing a research paper is beneficial. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, this course would give students the essential research skills that will benefit them throughout their academic journey. As a student who initially struggled to navigate the library's vast resources, I recognize the value of understanding how to effectively locate and evaluate scholarly materials. Secondly, writing a long research paper will foster critical thinking and analytical abilities. I recall the sense of accomplishment when I completed my first research paper…

I personally think that requiring first-year students to take a class on utilizing university library resources and writing a research paper is not a good idea. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, such a rule could restrict students' academic exploration and limit their ability to pursue diverse interests. Secondly, some students may already possess strong research and writing skills from their high school experiences or personal endeavors. For instance, I had already completed extensive research projects before entering university, and being required to take a basic course would have felt redundant and limited my academic growth.

While both approaches to answering student questions during a lecture have their merits, I believe that waiting until the end of class to address inquiries is generally a more effective strategy. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, it allows the professor to maintain a smooth flow of the lecture and cover the planned material without interruptions. Secondly, addressing questions at the end of class provides an opportunity for comprehensive and focused discussions. Students can reflect on the lecture as a whole and ask more meaningful and thought-provoking questions. So, that’s why I think that waiting until the end of class to answer questions is better.

I personally think that the second approach, where professors stop at different points during the lecture to answer student questions, is a more effective strategy. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, it promotes active engagement and participation from students. Personally, I have found that this interactive style of teaching fosters a dynamic learning environment where students feel more comfortable and motivated to actively contribute to the discussion. Secondly, addressing questions in real time helps in the immediate comprehension of complex topics. As a student, I have benefited from this approach as it enables me to grasp challenging concepts more effectively and feel more confident.

I personally enjoy organizing and planning parties or social events. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, organizing events allows me to exercise my creativity. For instance, I recently organized a Harry Potter-themed party, complete with themed decorations, costumes, and magical-themed games, which created a memorable experience for everyone involved. Secondly, planning events enables me to foster connections and bring people together. A prime example of this was when I organized a charity event that brought together various community members, sparking meaningful conversations and collaborations for a greater cause.

I personally find more enjoyment in simply attending events that I have been invited to. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, being an attendee allows me to fully immerse myself in the experience without the added stress and responsibilities of organizing. For instance, attending a friend's birthday party allowed me to focus solely on celebrating their special day and connecting with other guests without any worries. Secondly, attending events allows me to embrace spontaneity and flexibility. By not being burdened with the planning process, I have the freedom to explore different events and accept invitations that align with my interests at any given moment.

I strongly agree with the statement that students who are physically active and exercise regularly are more likely to succeed academically. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, physical activity enhances cognitive function and improves focus. Personally, I have experienced this correlation in my own life. On days when I incorporate physical activity into my routine, I find myself more alert and able to absorb information effectively. Secondly, regular exercise promotes better sleep patterns, which are crucial for optimal academic performance. Physical activity helps regulate our sleep-wake cycle, ensuring a more restful night's sleep.

I respectfully disagree with the statement that students who are physically active and exercise regularly are more likely to succeed academically. I feel this way for two reasons. Firstly, academic success depends on various factors such as study habits, time management, and intellectual abilities. Physical activity alone does not guarantee academic achievement. For instance, I have known highly successful students who prioritize their academic responsibilities and excel in their studies without engaging in regular exercise. Secondly, academic success is a multifaceted outcome influenced by diverse factors, including personal motivation, access to resources, and educational support systems.

                1.1.	I personally prefer to visit an art museum alone rather than with friends or colleagues. Going alone allows me to immerse myself fully in the artworks without distractions. I can take my time to contemplate each piece, appreciate its intricacies, and reflect on its significance without feeling rushed. Additionally, being alone enhances my focus and enables me to connect more deeply with the art, which ultimately enriches my overall museum experience. Therefore, I believe visiting an art museum alone provides me with the optimal environment to fully appreciate and engage with the artworks.

When visiting with friends, we can share our interpretations and reactions to the artwork, sparking insightful discussions and debates. This collaborative approach to viewing art enhances my understanding and appreciation of the pieces, as I gain new insights and viewpoints from my companions.

                1.1.	I personally prefer shopping at specialty shops like butcher shops and bakeries over supermarkets. For example, I recently visited a local butcher shop where I found freshly cut, locally sourced meats that were far superior in quality to those found in supermarkets. The personalized service and advice from the staff … it made my shopping experience enjoyable and educational. Additionally, knowing that my purchase supports local businesses and contributes to the community adds to the satisfaction of shopping at specialty shops. So that’s why I don’t normally shop everything all at once at a supermarket.

                1.2.	I believe that shopping for everything at once at a supermarket is better for several reasons. Firstly, supermarkets offer a wide variety of products under one roof, providing convenience and efficiency for shoppers. Instead of visiting multiple specialty shops for different items like meat, bread, and produce, shoppers can find everything they need in a single trip to the supermarket. This saves time and effort, allowing shoppers to complete their grocery shopping quickly and efficiently. Additionally, supermarkets typically have larger inventories and greater availability of products compared to specialty shops.

                1.1.	I agree that children need to learn independence from an early age. Developing independence fosters essential life skills and prepares children for adulthood. For instance, learning to dress themselves, manage their belongings, and solve simple problems independently builds confidence and self-reliance. Moreover, independence encourages critical thinking and decision-making skills, enabling children to navigate various situations with autonomy. For example, allowing children to make choices about their activities or chores encourages responsibility and self-discipline.

                1.2.	I disagree with the statement that children need to learn independence at an early age. While independence is a valuable skill, pushing children to become independent too early can have negative consequences. Firstly, young children may not have the cognitive or emotional maturity to handle independence effectively. They may lack the decision-making skills and judgment necessary to navigate complex situations on their own. Secondly, children thrive in environments where they feel supported and nurtured. Teaching independence at too young an age may inadvertently create feelings of insecurity and anxiety in children.

Firstly, not all students may have access to their own laptops. Some students may come from low-income backgrounds or face financial constraints that prevent them from purchasing personal laptops. Secondly, even among students who do own laptops, there may be limitations in terms of device capabilities or software compatibility. The university-owned computers in the computer lab are likely to be equipped with specialized software and hardware that may not be available on students' personal laptop.
