Prepare a comprehensive written response. Please follow each part instructions very carefully and don't be lazy.The response should be structured into four key sections as follows:

### 1. Content Creation:

​	Adjust the content to maintain a smooth and natural flow (it's really important). Focus particularly on demonstrating clear and coherent speech (delivery), precise and appropriate language use (language use), and well-developed responses that logically address the topics of provided question (topic development). Tailor the essay to adhere to the TOEFL writing rubrics, emphasizing clear and logical development of ideas (organization), precise and varied language use (language use), and effective argumentation and support (content quality). for the content you can also use Perplexity-AI.md contents.

​	The content should be suitable for oral speaking and suitable for converting it as a transcript to audio file. It should contain ideas, brainstorming, and collocations and help learners understand suitable grammars from sentences, expand their vocabulary, and develop coherent arguments. 

### 2. Brainstorming and Ideas:

​	List innovative brainstorming ideas relevant to the topic that you used in the Content Creation part, providing a brief explanation for each on how it could be developed into a structured response. In this part of your response, you should write the reasons with their general topics and a brief explanation for each one. This is intended to serve as an idea bank and brainstorming resource, so focus on general ideas that are easy to remember. Additionally, consider the provided [Perplexity-AI.md](https://chatgpt.com/Perplexity-AI.md) file for inspiration. Feel free to include other helpful ideas for brainstorming about the topic and question.

also Write outline of perfect sample answer.



### 3. Sample Answer:

- Craft a full high scoring sample essay in response to the specified TOEFL writing prompt based on the brainstormed ideas and according to the rubric. The essay should clearly demonstrate effective organization, advanced vocabulary use, and robust development of ideas, all within the context of the TOEFL writing rubrics. Ensure the essay is engaging, academically appropriate, and communicates the arguments effectively.
  - For the Writing sample, provide a response which for non-native English learner takes about 10 minutes to provide, aiming for the highest score according to the TOEFL writing rubric.
  - The sample must adhere to the rubrics provided and be structured to achieve the highest score in the respective section of the TOEFL exam.

### 4. Reference and Explanation of Collocations:

- Provide a detailed one list of all collocations (for collocations from the file collocation.txt and for additional collocation used), used in your response (Content Creation, Brainstorming and Ideas, Sample Answer), with very brief explanation. 
- Provide another list of collocations from file I provided with their number in the provided file.  - collocation (row number)

Each section of the response should be clearly marked and elaborate on how the content meets the TOEFL writing section’s scoring criteria, providing practical and educational insight into crafting a high-scoring TOEFL writing response.

question [Writing]: 

Your professor is teaching a class on political science. Write a post responding to the professor’s question. In your response, you should express and support your personal opinion and make a contribution to the discussion in your own words An effective response will contain at least 100 words.
Professor: Today we’re going to discuss whether the government should tax unhealthy products, such as sugary drinks and junk food. On one hand, taxing these products could discourage people from consuming them and reduce health problems. On the other hand, some argue that such taxes unfairly target lower-income families who may rely on these products as affordable sources of food. If you had to choose, would you support or oppose taxing unhealthy products? Why?
Sam: I support the idea of taxing unhealthy products. These products are often high in sugar, salt, and fat, which can lead to serious health problems such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. As you said, by taxing these products, the government can discourage people from consuming them and resolve some of these health issues. Moreover, the revenue generated from such taxes can be used to fund advertising campaigns that promote healthy eating habits.
Tanya: I disagree. I believe that such taxes are unfair to families that don’t have a lot of money. Wealthy people will not care about the taxes and their habits won’t change. Additionally, if these taxes are implemented people might try to save money by purchasing lower-quality products that are cheaper in the first place. That means they could suffereven more health problems.
