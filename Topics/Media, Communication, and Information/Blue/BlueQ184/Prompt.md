Prepare a comprehensive response. Please follow each part instructions very carefully and don't be lazy.

The response should be structured into four key sections as follows:

### 1. Content Creation:

​	Develop a detailed passage (more than 2 paragraph) around the provided question topics, use several collocations from the attached file (collocation.txt) and additional collocations useful for TOEFL preparation. Bold all collocations.

Adjust the content to maintain a smooth and natural flow (it's really important). Focus particularly on demonstrating clear and coherent speech (delivery), precise and appropriate language use (language use), and well-developed responses that logically address the topics of provided question (topic development). for the content you can also use Perplexity-AI.md contents.

​	The content should be suitable for oral speaking and suitable for converting it as a transcript to audio file. It should contain ideas, brainstorming, and collocations and help learners understand grammar from sentences, expand their vocabulary, and develop coherent arguments.

### 2. Brainstorming and Ideas:

​	List innovative brainstorming ideas relevant to the topic that you used in the Content Creation part, providing a brief explanation for each on how it could be developed into a structured response. In this part of your response, you should write the reasons with their general topics and a brief explanation for each one. This is intended to serve as an idea bank and brainstorming resource, so focus on general ideas that are easy to remember. Additionally, consider the provided [Perplexity-AI.md](https://chatgpt.com/Perplexity-AI.md) file for inspiration. Feel free to include other helpful ideas for brainstorming about the topic and question.

### 3. Sample Answer:

- Craft a high scoring sample answer to the specified TOEFL speaking question based on the brainstormed ideas and according to the rubric. Ensure the response is coherent, fluently delivered, and demonstrates effective use of targeted vocabulary and collocations. The sample should adhere strictly to the TOEFL speaking rubrics, ideally within a 40-second delivery window for speaking.
  - For the speaking sample, provide a response of about 35-40 seconds, suitable for a non-native speaker (with normal speed) aiming for the highest score according to the TOEFL speaking rubric. I don't want longer sample.
  - The sample must adhere to the rubrics provided and be structured to achieve the highest score in the respective section of the TOEFL exam.

### 4. Reference and Explanation of Collocations:

- Provide a detailed one list of all collocations (for collocations from the file collocation.txt and for additional collocation used), used in your response (Content Creation, Brainstorming and Ideas, Sample Answer), with very brief explanation. 
- Provide another list of collocations from file I provided with their number in the provided file.  - collocation (row number)

Ensure each section of the response is distinctly marked and elaborates on how the content can meet the TOEFL speaking section’s scoring criteria, providing a practical and educational insight into creating a high-scoring TOEFL speaking response.

| Score | General Description                                          | Delivery                                                     | Language Use                                                 | Topic Development                                            |

| 4     | The response fulfills the demands of the task, with a mature response in a complex issue. It is highly intelligible and exhibits sustained, coherent discourse. Characterized by a level of response at this level is the following: | Generally well-paced flow (but it may include speech disruptions). Smooth transitions, minor difficulties with pauses, or articulation not compromising flow or overall intelligibility. | The response demonstrates vocabulary usage of familiarity with diverse registers and a high degree of automaticity and good control of basic syntactic structures (as appropriate). Some minor (or not) disturbances are noticeable. | Response is sustained and sufficient to develop the topic. Reveals the well-linked ties between relationships (where it's clear as progression of ideas). |
| 3     | The response addresses the task appropriately but may fall short of being fully developed. It is generally intelligible and coherent, with some fluidity of expression, though it exhibits the gaps in the level of ideas. A response at this level is characterized by the omission of the following: | Speech is generally clear, with some fluidity of expression, though minor difficulties with pronunciation, intonation, or pacing are noticeable and may require listener effort (but are not significantly affected). | The response demonstrates fairly uniform and articulate syntax but some more advanced structures or vocabulary could help. Response may reflect inconsistencies or limited use of more advanced syntactic structures or grammatical structures in the language sometimes used. The tone may not seriously influence but it does affect overall fluency with the communication partner. | Response is mostly coherent and sustained and conveys relevant information. Overall development is somewhat limited, usually lacks elaboration, or perspective relationships between ideas may at times not be immediately clear. |
| 2     | The response addresses the task but is incomplete, contains problems, is disjointed without overall coherence or sustained meaning with delivery and/or problems may be accured in places. A response at this level is characterized by at least two of the following: | Speech is basically intelligible, though listener effort is needed because of unclear articulation, awkward intonation, or choppy rhythm/pace; meaning may be obscured in places. | The response demonstrates limited grammar and vocabulary. Mistakes and conflicts of expression are bad for the interpretation of ideas. Sentence structures vary but feel constant, must express, and successfully support plain vocabulary (may errors and simplicity occur). | The response is disconnected to the task, though the number of ideas presented are limited. Mostly basic ideas is elaborated with limited support. At times vaguely expressed may be relevant to subtopic or interpretations. Communication issues. |
| 1     | The response is very limited in content and/or coherence or is unintelligible. A response at this level is mainly characterized by at least two of the following: | Consistent pronunciation, stress and intonation difficulties, considerably choppier, fragmented delivery is likely; frequent pauses, or considerable stammer, stutter, and hesitations. | Range and control of grammar and vocabulary significantly limited. Constant expression ideas and prevention errors may come or become annoying of less formally recognized or previously on practised. | Limited relevant content is expressed. The response generally lacks substance beyond superficial or very basic ideas. Depends may be unable to sustain and may heavily repeat the task specified to complete on repetition of the prompt. |
| 0     | Speaker makes no attempt to respond OR response is unrelated to the topic. |                                                              |                                                              |                                                              |
