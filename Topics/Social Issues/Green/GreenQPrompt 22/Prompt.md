Focus particularly on demonstrating clear and coherent speech (delivery), precise and appropriate language use (language use), and well-developed responses that logically address the topics of provided question (topic development). Tailor the essay to adhere to the TOEFL writing rubrics, emphasizing clear and logical development of ideas (organization), precise and varied language use (language use), and effective argumentation and support (content quality). for the content you can also use Perplexity-AI.md contents.

​	The content should be suitable for oral speaking and suitable for converting it as a transcript to audio file. It should contain ideas, brainstorming, and collocations and help learners understand suitable grammars from sentences, expand their vocabulary, and develop coherent arguments. 

### 2. Brainstorming and Ideas:

​	List innovative brainstorming ideas relevant to the topic that you used in the Content Creation part, providing a brief explanation for each on how it could be developed into a structured response. In this part of your response, you should write the reasons with their general topics and a brief explanation for each one. This is intended to serve as an idea bank and brainstorming resource, so focus on general ideas that are easy to remember. Additionally, consider the provided [Perplexity-AI.md](https://chatgpt.com/Perplexity-AI.md) file for inspiration. Feel free to include other helpful ideas for brainstorming about the topic and question.

also Write outline of perfect sample answer.



### 3. Sample Answer:

- Craft a full high scoring sample essay in response to the specified TOEFL writing prompt based on the brainstormed ideas and according to the rubric. The essay should clearly demonstrate effective organization, advanced vocabulary use, and robust development of ideas, all within the context of the TOEFL writing rubrics. Ensure the essay is engaging, academically appropriate, and communicates the arguments effectively.
  - For the Writing sample, provide a response which for non-native English learner takes about 10 minutes to provide, aiming for the highest score according to the TOEFL writing rubric.
  - The sample must adhere to the rubrics provided and be structured to achieve the highest score in the respective section of the TOEFL exam.

### 4. Reference and Explanation of Collocations:

- Provide a detailed one list of all collocations (for collocations from the file collocation.txt and for additional collocation used), used in your response (Content Creation, Brainstorming and Ideas, Sample Answer), with very brief explanation. 
- Provide another list of collocations from file I provided with their number in the provided file.  - collocation (row number)

Each section of the response should be clearly marked and elaborate on how the content meets the TOEFL writing section’s scoring criteria, providing practical and educational insight into crafting a high-scoring TOEFL writing response.

question [Writing]: 

Your professor is teaching a class on sociology. Write a post responding to the professor's question. In your response, you should do the following. • Express and support your opinion. • Make a contribution to the discussion in your own words. An effective response will contain at least 100 words.
Andrew: I agree. Families feel more connected while working together rather than while doing passive activities, such as watching TV. While working together, family members have an opportunity to engage in an in-depth discussion and share their thoughts and feelings. Working toward a common goal, such as planting a garden, helps families create happy memories and feel a sense of accomplishment.
Claire: I don't think working together is the best way for every family to strengthen family bonds because every family is different and even within one family, it is difficult to find tasks that are interesting to everyone. While working together, family members may disagree about how to best accomplish tasks, which may result in an argument.
Doctor Gupta: This week, we'll be looking into family dynamics. One common concern in our field is that due to busy schedules, many families have limited time to spend together, so connections within families may grow weaker over time. Let's begin by discussing the following viewpoint: the best way for a family to strengthen family bonds is to work on something together, for example, cooking, gardening, or working on a craft project. Do you agree or disagree with this viewpoint? Why?
