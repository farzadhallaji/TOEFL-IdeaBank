### 1. Sample Answer:

I strongly agree that it is more difficult to be a parent nowadays than in the past. Firstly, the fast pace of modern life means parents often have to juggle multiple responsibilities, including demanding jobs and household chores, which leaves them with less time to spend with their children. Secondly, the influence of technology and social media exposes children to various risks and pressures, such as cyberbullying and unrealistic standards. Lastly, the cost of living has increased significantly, making it harder for parents to provide for their families. Therefore, these factors combined make parenting today more challenging than in the past.
