### 1. Sample Answer:

I strongly agree that schools should require students to attend cultural events like visiting an art museum. Firstly, these experiences enrich students' education beyond the classroom, offering exposure to diverse perspectives and artistic expressions. For example, viewing an art exhibition can enhance students' appreciation of history and creativity. Secondly, cultural events foster critical thinking and discussion skills. Engaging with different forms of art can prompt students to analyze and interpret meanings, thus improving their cognitive abilities. Lastly, attending these events can inspire students to explore their own creative interests, potentially guiding them toward new hobbies or careers. Therefore, mandatory attendance at cultural events is highly beneficial for students' overall development.
