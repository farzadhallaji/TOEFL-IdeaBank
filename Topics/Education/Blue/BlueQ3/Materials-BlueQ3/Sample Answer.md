### 1. Sample Answer:

I disagree with the students who think humanities courses are irrelevant for math and science majors. Humanities courses, like literature and philosophy, are crucial for developing critical thinking and communication skills. For instance, studying literature enhances empathy and cultural awareness, which are valuable in any field. Philosophy teaches logical reasoning and ethical decision-making, skills that are essential in scientific research and problem-solving. Furthermore, humanities courses foster creativity, which can lead to innovative solutions in technical fields. Therefore, these courses are not only relevant but also beneficial for students in math and science disciplines.
