Prepare a comprehensive response. Please follow each part instructions very carefully 

### 1.Sample Answer:

- Craft a high scoring sample answer to the specified TOEFL speaking question based on the brainstormed ideas and according to the rubric. Ensure the response is coherent, fluently delivered, and demonstrates effective use of targeted vocabulary and collocations. The sample should adhere strictly to the TOEFL speaking rubrics, ideally within a 45-second delivery window for speaking.
  - For the speaking sample, provide a response of about 45 seconds, suitable for a non-native speaker (with normal speed) aiming for the highest score according to the TOEFL speaking rubric. I don't want longer sample.
  - The sample must adhere to the rubrics provided and be structured to achieve the highest score in the respective section of the TOEFL exam.

### 2. Brainstorming and Ideas:

List brainstorming ideas relevant to the topic, providing a brief explanation for each on how it could be developed into a structured response. In this part of your response, you should write the reasons with their general topics and a brief explanation for each one. This is intended to serve as an idea bank and brainstorming resource, so focus on general ideas that are easy to remember.

| 4     | The response fulfills the demands of the task, with a mature response in a complex issue. It is highly intelligible and exhibits sustained, coherent discourse. Characterized by a level of response at this level is the following: | Generally well-paced flow (but it may include speech disruptions). Smooth transitions, minor difficulties with pauses, or articulation not compromising flow or overall intelligibility. | The response demonstrates vocabulary usage of familiarity with diverse registers and a high degree of automaticity and good control of basic syntactic structures (as appropriate). Some minor (or not) disturbances are noticeable. | Response is sustained and sufficient to develop the topic. Reveals the well-linked ties between relationships (where it's clear as progression of ideas). |
| 3     | The response addresses the task appropriately but may fall short of being fully developed. It is generally intelligible and coherent, with some fluidity of expression, though it exhibits the gaps in the level of ideas. A response at this level is characterized by the omission of the following: | Speech is generally clear, with some fluidity of expression, though minor difficulties with pronunciation, intonation, or pacing are noticeable and may require listener effort (but are not significantly affected). | The response demonstrates fairly uniform and articulate syntax but some more advanced structures or vocabulary could help. Response may reflect inconsistencies or limited use of more advanced syntactic structures or grammatical structures in the language sometimes used. The tone may not seriously influence but it does affect overall fluency with the communication partner. | Response is mostly coherent and sustained and conveys relevant information. Overall development is somewhat limited, usually lacks elaboration, or perspective relationships between ideas may at times not be immediately clear. |
| 2     | The response addresses the task but is incomplete, contains problems, is disjointed without overall coherence or sustained meaning with delivery and/or problems may be accured in places. A response at this level is characterized by at least two of the following: | Speech is basically intelligible, though listener effort is needed because of unclear articulation, awkward intonation, or choppy rhythm/pace; meaning may be obscured in places. | The response demonstrates limited grammar and vocabulary. Mistakes and conflicts of expression are bad for the interpretation of ideas. Sentence structures vary but feel constant, must express, and successfully support plain vocabulary (may errors and simplicity occur). | The response is disconnected to the task, though the number of ideas presented are limited. Mostly basic ideas is elaborated with limited support. At times vaguely expressed may be relevant to subtopic or interpretations. Communication issues. |
| 1     | The response is very limited in content and/or coherence or is unintelligible. A response at this level is mainly characterized by at least two of the following: | Consistent pronunciation, stress and intonation difficulties, considerably choppier, fragmented delivery is likely; frequent pauses, or considerable stammer, stutter, and hesitations. | Range and control of grammar and vocabulary significantly limited. Constant expression ideas and prevention errors may come or become annoying of less formally recognized or previously on practised. | Limited relevant content is expressed. The response generally lacks substance beyond superficial or very basic ideas. Depends may be unable to sustain and may heavily repeat the task specified to complete on repetition of the prompt. |
| 0     | Speaker makes no attempt to respond OR response is unrelated to the topic. |                                                              |                                                              |                                                              |

also this is a video transcript from ETS TOEFL about Speaking question:

For this task, you'll be given a topic to speak about with no additional reading or listening passages. You'll have 15 seconds to prepare your response and 45 seconds to speak your answer. you'll be presented with two situations or opinions. You'll be asked which you prefer and you need to explain your choice.
Here's an example: Some people think it is more fun to spend time with friends in restaurants or cafes. Others think it is more fun to spend time with friends at home. Which do you think is better? Explain why.
Now here are some tips for how to approach these kinds of speaking questions.

1. Use the preparation time to organize your thoughts and maybe jot down some notes.Don't try to write a full response because you won't have time, and the raters scoring your response want to hear you speaking, not reading, and they can tell the difference.
2. Don't memorize responses before the test, especially ones that you get from the Internet or from test prep instructors who say that's a good idea. It's not, and it will lower your score. It's very easy for ETS raters to identify memorized responses because they sound different and the content is different from responses that are more natural and spontaneous.
3. It's not necessary to organize your response into an introduction, a middle and a conclusion like you would with a written essay. Just speak naturally and use common connecting words. 
   Some of those are:
   because, so, after that,on the other hand, I want to mention, and what this means is.
   Before the test, make sure you understand what the raters are looking for and how the questions are scored. In the speaking section, all responses are scored on a scale from zero to four, and they're scored holistically, which means the raters listen for various features in your response and then give it an overall score.

Although there are some variations depending on the questions, raters will be looking for three main things.

1. delivery: Your speech needs to be clear and fluid with good pronunciation. The pace or speed of your speech should be natural, and you should have good sounding intonation patterns.
2. language use: This is mainly how you use grammar and vocabulary to express your ideas.
3. topic development: This is mainly how fully you answer the question, how clearly you express your ideas, and how you can connect one idea to the next in a way that is easy to follow.

Now, let's listen to an example of the speaking response that received the highest score of four out of four.
This is responding to the question about spending time with friends: I actually only spend time with my friends in restaurants and cafés, almost never at home because my apartment is very small and there is just almost nothing to do. On the outside and café and restaurants, it's much more - there are more people. The atmosphere is usually good. Maybe there's some music playing. Usually we meet to discuss things and meet other people and meet people we do not know, possibly. There's always a chance to get to know someone and it's always exciting. For me, it's much more exciting than just staying at home in the environment that I know and am familiar with. I think that's boring.
Now, let's look at this response in terms of our three main criteria delivery, language use and topic development.
First, delivery: His flow of speech is good and he's easy to understand, and he's able to sustain his speech for the full 45 seconds without repeating himself. With language use, his language is simple and direct and he chooses his words accurately.
He doesn't need to use overly complex vocabulary. 
Topic development is also strong. He starts by stating his preference for cafés and also says why he doesn't meet his friends at his home and he gives several reasons why cafés are better for him. There's a better atmosphere, often there is music, and he can meet new people.
So, overall this meets the criteria for a score of four out of four.
