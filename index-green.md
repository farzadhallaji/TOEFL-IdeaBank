Doctor Achebe: Let's think about population trends in urban and rural areas (villages). Living in urban areas can be expensive; nonetheless, when they have a choice of where to live, people in some countries do not wish to live in rural areas even if the cost of living there is lower. If governments of some countries want to attract more people to live in rural areas or villages, what is the best strategy or approach that governments can use? Why?
Claire: I would live in a rural area if the government gave more financial help to farmers. Although it may cost very little to live in a rural area, it costs a lot to begin a career in agriculture. If I had financial help, I would start my own farm and be happy to live in a rural area.
Kelly: In my country, urban centers are great places to live because you can access shops, restaurants, and museums. If the government of my country wanted to attract me to live in a rural area, the area would first have to attract more businesses focused on entertainment and culture than most rural areas have now.

Doctor Gupta: This week, I want you to discuss assessment criteria. Some schoolteachers give high grades (marks) only to those students who perform well on their homework assignments and tests. Other teachers, however, may give high grades to students who have worked very hard on their assignments but have not performed so well. Which approach do you think is better: Giving grades based only on performance, or grading students not just on performance but also on their effort?
Kelly: I think grades should be based on performance only. It's a matter of fairness. I'd be really upset if another student got nearly the same grade that I did when I turned in work that was almost perfect and the other student's work had incorrect answers or unclear ideas. It wouldn't matter to me if they worked harder.
Paul: Sure, evaluation should mainly be based upon the student's performance, but hard work should count for something. A student who works hard, even when the final grade isn't the highest in the class, builds character, which will benefit the student later in life when they go to university or apply for a job.

Doctor Diaz: Nowadays, the world is facing a number of pressing environmental problems, and over the next few weeks, we'll be discussing various innovations that may help solve these problems. To begin our discussion, I'd like you to think of one global environmental problem-for example, it could be related to water, air, land, climate, biodiversity, energy, or something similar. Then explain what you think would be an effective solution to this problem.
Kelly: One of the major environmental problems is the limited freshwater supply in many areas of the world, which means that we need to find effective technologies to provide people with enough drinking water. One solution is to improve the technology for removing salt from seawater, which could allow us to use seawater to replenish dwindling freshwater supplies.
Paul: I think the biggest problem is the air pollution caused by the overuse of motorized vehicles. The obvious solution is for local governments to promote alternatives, like building bike lanes in cities or improving public transportation with electric buses. Both of these would be easy to implement as well.

Doctor Achebe: This week, we'll look at how well students transition to university. Many recent high school graduates have taken a gap year-a yearlong break after graduation-before studying at a university. During a gap year, students may get jobs, travel, or simply relax and think about their future. Some students say their gap year was beneficial, while others regret having taken one. In your opinion, does taking a gap year create more advantages or disadvantages for students? Why?
Andrew: The gap year would be a good opportunity for students to reflect on their education goals and confirm their plans for university. At least it would give someone time to investigate different fields and get a better sense of what it means to be in business, to work in an office, or to work with their hands, etc.
Claire: Because university can be expensive, students should not take a gap year. Tuition, the cost of books, and living expenses rise every year. The money a student might save during a gap year might not be enough to cover the rise in prices when they enter university a year later.

Doctor Achebe: In our textbook, we read that parks and other green spaces with trees and plants have numerous benefits for people in cities. But city governments sometimes must choose between using a piece of available land as a green space or using it for other important purposes, such as for shopping areas or for manufacturing plants. In your opinion, which is the better use for available urban space? Why?
Kelly: It's true that parks can benefit people in cities, especially health-wise. But it's more important to use the limited space for things that people cannot survive without, like hospitals or clinics. Medical care is often an urgent necessity. Visiting a park is not.
Claire: I'm all for creating green spaces for people to enjoy, but you don't necessarily need an open piece of land to do that. Let the available land be used for business or housing purposes. Green spaces can be created on the rooftops of existing buildings. And new buildings can be constructed creatively to include open spaces with plants and trees.

Doctor Diaz: We've been discussing the importance of hiring and retaining highly skilled employees, but even the best employees may need to periodically update or further develop their work skills. One question facing managers is how much time and money to invest in improving the work skills of their employees. Some managers argue that ongoing employee training is the most important investment a company can make. What are your thoughts on the matter?
Andrew: I don't think that employee training is the most important investment a company can make. The company should be hiring the most skilled workers it can find in the first place. There are so many other unavoidable things that a company needs to spend money on that have to take precedence over training.
Kelly: Employees' leaving their jobs is always a risk, but providing ongoing training and skill development is more likely to make employees want to stay rather than go, in my opinion. When employers pay for training, employees are likely to feel more valued by their employer, and this can only improve the employer-employee relationship.

Doctor Achebe: Companies now make computer games designed to help very young children learn. The games are advertised for use by children aged 2 to 8 years and often involve basic math and reading skills, presented in a fun, game-like style. Some people say that this results in children spending too much time looking at computer screens. Do you think it's a good idea for very young children to play educational computer games? Why or why not?
Andrew: I think it's completely inappropriate for children as young as 2 years old to play what are essentially video games. Even if the games are educational, the same skills can be taught in traditional ways-by reading books to children, for example. And it would be beneficial to interact with their parents in this way.
Kelly: Considering how important computers are to human societies these days, I think it actually makes sense to allow very young children to explore them. And if the computer games that children play also give them early access to subject matter that will later be taught in school, all the better.

Doctor Achebe: In 1930, a famous economist predicted that at the end of the twentieth century, an average worker would work only 15 hours a week, thanks to advances in technology. This did not happen, as we all know. Nonetheless, the balance between work time and free time remains an interesting question. So, let me ask you today: Twenty years in the future, will people have more leisure time (free time) and less work than they have today? Why, or why not?
Claire: I think it is likely that people will work shorter hours in twenty years than they do today. Our societies are becoming wealthier all the time. It does not seem necessary for people to continue working as hard as they do today. At some point, having more free time should be more important than creating more wealth.
Paul: I am not sure people will work less in the future. As Doctor Achebe wrote, a shortening of the workweek was predicted before. There are many factors that determine how long people work. Our economic system is very competitive. Workers are pushed to work longer and longer hours so that companies have a competitive advantage.

Doctor Diaz: This week, we've discussed how carbon dioxide released by gasoline-powered (petrol-powered) cars pollutes the air and contributes to climate change. Let's focus now on two proposals that governments can consider as they try to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from cars. One proposal is to improve and expand public transportation. The other is to provide financial support to companies that make electric cars and to consumers who buy them. Which proposal do you think is better? Why?
Claire: I think improving public transportation would be more beneficial overall than giving tax breaks or rebates to particular companies and consumers. If taking a train or a bus is significantly easier, cheaper, and faster than driving a car, more people will want to use public transportation. With fewer cars on the road, there will be less air pollution.
Paul: I believe that providing financial support to electric-car manufacturers and consumers is the better innovative long- term strategy. Many people live in rural areas, and they need their own vehicles to get around. These people would not benefit from, say, more train lines being built in a far-off city.

Doctor Diaz: Our current unit looks at tourism and the benefit it has on a country's economy. Many argue that while tourism can indeed be a money-making endeavor, it can do more harm than good, especially tourism to small, remote places that are not heavily populated. What is your opinion? Should local or national governments promote tourism to remote regions not typically visited by tourists before? Why?
Andrew: Tourism has always been a lucrative business. Improving the economies of these rural regions, especially if those regions are poor, can only have a positive effect. People can have a better quality of life by showcasing their food and traditions to the outside world. It's a chance the people might not get without promotion from the government.
Claire: I don't think governments should promote tourism to remote regions. The people are likely not asking for this kind of industry or for this kind of attention. Instead, governments should develop other means of improving a region's economic situation, like expanding agriculture or other industries. These efforts will have a stronger, more permanent impact on the region than bringing in groups of tourists.

Claire: In my country, there is a lack of affordable housing in the big cities. Low-cost housing exists in areas outside of the cities, but that means workers have long commutes to reach their jobs in the cities. I recommend that my government create initiatives to encourage the construction of large buildings with many affordable apartments in cities.
Paul: Claire's recommendation is fine, but many people prefer to live in a house rather than an apartment, even if they have longer commutes. Living in a house can be quieter and more private. So, I believe my government should give subsidies or tax relief to construction companies to build small, affordable single- family houses on unused land that surrounds many cities.
Doctor Gupta: This week, we will be discussing a shortage of affordable housing that exists in many countries. In these places, housing-both apartments (flats) and houses-are expensive, because populations are growing faster than new housing is being built. Now, think about places in your country that have a housing shortage. In your post, I would like you to indicate the most effective way for the government to address a housing shortage in your country. Please explain why you think so.

Doctor Gupta: Let's discuss how teachers' job performance is assessed or evaluated. Regular evaluations of teachers help to ensure that students receive high-quality instruction, that good teachers are rewarded, and that struggling teachers receive help to improve. But what is the best way to evaluate teachers? Should teachers be evaluated based on their students' test scores? Should more-experienced teachers evaluate less- experienced teachers? Should students' feedback be considered? Which approach is best, and why?
Andrew: I think experienced senior teachers are the best source of information for teacher evaluations. School leaders can assign experienced teachers to observe their fellow teachers periodically during class, and these senior teachers can then provide feedback on their colleagues' performance. An experienced teacher has the knowledge to determine what other teachers are doing well and what needs improvement.
Kelly: I'm not convinced that any one person's occasional visits to a classroom would provide accurate information. I'd like a more objective, fairer source of data, so I'd prefer to rely on test scores to inform teacher evaluations. If all students take the same test, and some classes perform better than others, then we know which teachers have been most successful.

Doctor Diaz: Teachers often ask school administrators for permission to take their students on field trips (for example, to museums or historical buildings). Some school administrators provide funding and encouragement for teachers to organize educational trips for the entire class. Many believe that going on field trips is an important part of a child's education; others think that a child's time is better spent learning in a classroom at school. Which view do you agree with? Why?
Kelly: Field trips are so demanding of a teacher's time; I can understand why some people aren't in favor of them. Teachers can't just decide that it might be fun to take their class to an art museum. They must plan carefully to help children get the most out of that trip while not losing too much instructional time.
Paul: Field trips can affect kids' futures in important ways. One time I went on a field trip to a space museum when I was young. I even got to try on a space suit. That experience made me want to be an astronomer. I might not have developed my interest in astronomy without that field trip experience.

Doctor Gupta: When students are preparing to graduate from university, they need to make decisions about what kind of company they want to work for. They might consider large, older companies with an established reputation, or possibly new start-up companies, which tend to be small but very focused on the future. Consider the advantages of each. Would it generally be better for a new university graduate to begin working for a large, established company, or for a small start-up company? Why?
Kelly: I think in general, the established company is the better choice. Because they're already well-known, these companies have a certain amount of respect in the business community, so it would look good to have that job experience on your résumé. That advantage alone would be a great start for a recent graduate.
Andrew: I see your point, Kelly, but taking a position at a start-up company would offer so much excitement. They often have an energy that older companies can't match-everyone can be focused on new, innovative business practices and they would be more aggressive about getting new clients. That would be a much better experience for someone fresh out of university!

Doctor Diaz: Our next class will focus on how companies maintain their staffing levels. While it is important for a company to look for new employees to fill open positions, many believe it is equally important for a company to retain the workers it already has on staff. In your opinion, what is the best way for a company to encourage its employees to stay at the company instead of seeking a different job elsewhere?
Paul: I think the best thing a company could do to keep its employees is to create a work environment that employees look forward to going to five days a week. Cramped office spaces or disorderly factory floors are not places I would want to spend a third of my life.
Claire: I see Paul's point. But even more important than a nice workspace is making sure the employees don't feel stuck in their jobs. Companies should offer opportunities for employees to advance their skills so they can get new positions within the company if they want. Employees should feel like they have a goal to work toward.

Doctor Diaz: This week, we'll look at practices and activities used by primary and secondary school teachers. Let's begin by discussing journal writing activities. Some teachers ask students to keep a journal and to regularly write down their thoughts about a recent lesson or respond to a question presented by the teacher. There are also many teachers who never assign journal writing. Now, I'd like your opinion: Is journal writing a worthwhile activity to support learning? Why or why not?
Claire: I think getting students into the habit of writing reflectively can be very beneficial. Journal writing gives students an opportunity to develop their own ideas about what they're learning whether it's for a math class or a literature class. It could also give the teacher an informal way to gauge how well students are comprehending the lessons.
Paul: I'm not convinced journal writing is worthwhile in classes. Teachers have a lot of material to cover, and students have much to learn. Unless a student is particularly interested in journal keeping, the student might view journaling as just more busy work. For there to be a benefit, students would need to take it seriously. I don't think all would.

Doctor Achebe: Next, we'll be discussing the future of higher education, focusing on proposals for making postsecondary education (education after high school) more efficient and more accessible. One such proposal is to make class attendance optional. For instance, under an optional- attendance policy, university students could choose not to attend classes but instead study the course materials and acquire the knowledge on their own time. Their grade would then be based entirely on exams or papers. What are your thoughts on this approach?
Claire: I like the idea of optional attendance. University students have a lot going on, and sometimes it's difficult to make it to class. As long as students are held accountable for the information they're supposed to learn, I don't see why they should have to attend every class session, especially for classes that meet multiple times a week.
Andrew: I have to disagree with Claire. I think that class attendance policies foster another important kind of accountability. They teach discipline and responsibility. Many of the jobs that university or trade school students will pursue after graduation have their own attendance policies, so students should see class attendance as good preparation for entering the workforce.

Doctor Diaz: We've been discussing ways that parents can help prepare their teenage children for adulthood. One line of thinking is that parents should encourage their teenagers to take part-time jobs to help them learn to be responsible, even if it is not an economic necessity for the teenagers to work. What are your thoughts on the issue? Should parents urge teenage children to get a job? Why or why not?
Claire: Teenagers should work part-time. When I was 16, I washed dishes at a restaurant, and I'm glad I did. I learned a lot about time management. I had to use my free time wisely to make sure I could complete homework despite spending time working at a job. This is a valuable life skill.
Andrew: I would have to disagree. A teenager is still just a kid, and in my opinion, a kid needs to focus on going to school and learning. A job would be an unnecessary distraction. If it's all about learning responsibility, I think there are a lot of other ways to do that without the commitment required by a job.

Doctor Achebe: In our discussion on the importance of workplace mentoring, we learned that mentoring (training or guiding someone) is typically associated with senior employees-that is, workers who have been at a company for a long time and mentor younger colleagues. However, at some companies, especially those that use innovative technology, younger employees sometimes train or guide senior colleagues. Do you think that it is a good idea for companies to encourage younger employees to mentor senior coworkers? Why or why not?
Claire: I support the idea of having younger employees mentor senior ones. Technology is developing so rapidly these days, and young people are much more skilled in dealing with technology than older employees are. It's the ideal way for senior employees to learn new digital skills.
Kelly: Claire makes a good point, but technology aside, I do not think that younger employees make good mentors right away. When younger employees join companies, they often lack the experience needed to be fully effective in their roles. They should be mentored by senior coworkers who have achieved a high level of expertise in their work.

Doctor Achebe: This week, we'll be discussing how technological advances are transforming the job market, making some jobs unnecessary. Let's focus on government actions. Suppose the government had to choose between two ways in which to support people whose jobs are no longer needed. The government could either give them enough money to live on until they find new jobs or offer them free job training without giving them money directly. Which of these two solutions do you think is better? Why?
Andrew: I believe that the government should prioritize providing free job training opportunities. Modern training programs are usually costly, which means that many people will not be able to afford them without the government's funding. By participating in training programs, people will develop new, in- demand skills and become more competitive in the job market.
Kelly: Although I agree that having access to free training programs sounds promising, I think the government's first step should be to give people enough money to live on until they find new jobs. This money will go directly into people's pockets and allow them to make their own choices concerning their future.

Doctor Achebe: Teachers have to study for a long time to earn teaching degrees before they are ready to work in the classroom. Some people feel that in addition to earning a university degree, teachers should be required to take courses every few years to update their knowledge. Do you agree that there should be a mandate for teachers to take courses every few years, so they know the latest developments in their fields? Why or why not?
Andrew: I support this policy of making teachers continue to take courses throughout their careers. This is especially important for science teachers because new scientific discoveries are made all the time. Teachers need to be aware of any new developments in their content areas so they can update their lesson plans as needed to make sure students are getting current information.
Claire: I think this mandate sounds good in theory, but it might be hard to implement. Teachers already have very busy schedules, as they spend a lot of time preparing lessons, teaching, and grading. Teachers also often participate in different professional development opportunities, so taking mandatory courses on top of all this work might be burdensome for many teachers.

In your response, you should do the following. • Express and support your opinion. • Make a contribution to the discussion in your own words. An effective response will contain at least 100 words.
Andrew: I agree. Families feel more connected while working together rather than while doing passive activities, such as watching TV. While working together, family members have an opportunity to engage in an in-depth discussion and share their thoughts and feelings. Working toward a common goal, such as planting a garden, helps families create happy memories and feel a sense of accomplishment.
Claire: I don't think working together is the best way for every family to strengthen family bonds because every family is different and even within one family, it is difficult to find tasks that are interesting to everyone. While working together, family members may disagree about how to best accomplish tasks, which may result in an argument.
Doctor Gupta: This week, we'll be looking into family dynamics. One common concern in our field is that due to busy schedules, many families have limited time to spend together, so connections within families may grow weaker over time. Let's begin by discussing the following viewpoint: the best way for a family to strengthen family bonds is to work on something together, for example, cooking, gardening, or working on a craft project. Do you agree or disagree with this viewpoint? Why?

Dr. Diaz: This week we looked at how the cinema-the physical building where we watch films-has evolved over the years. Now, I want you to consider this question: with so many internet streaming services available for viewing films at home, do you think cinemas will cease to exist in the future? Will a time come when people stop going to cinemas entirely? Why or why not?
Paul: In my opinion, cinemas are here to stay. For thousands of years, people have been sharing the collective experience of watching a show, whether it was a live performance at a theater in ancient Greece or a recorded film in a cinema in today's society. And they will continue to want that shared viewing experience.
Claire: I agree that cinemas are becoming obsolete, but I don't think it's because of technology. Many of the best films these days are being produced as ten- or twelve-part miniseries, with much more focus on character development. These productions are meant to be watched on television. You don't need a big screen to enjoy them.

Doctor Achebe: Next week, we'll be discussing the role of museums in society, and we'll explore the various contexts, social and otherwise, in which museums operate. Today, I'd like you to think about the benefits of museums. For a city and its residents, what do you think is the most significant advantage of having a museum located in that city? Explain why you think
Andrew: Museums can inspire people in many ways. If a city has a museum, people have access to out-of-the-ordinary experiences. Whether in a room with sixteenth-century paintings or some moon rocks, being near fascinating objects from the past transports people out of their everyday lives. It can offer them a new perspective or a sense of possibility in their lives.
Claire: Andrew makes a good point, but personally, I see greater benefit in the social aspect of museum-going. I think the biggest advantage of having a museum nearby is that people can come together for events like exhibitions and lectures or to volunteer. Museums foster a sense of community in a city. They can unite people in a common appreciation of something.

Doctor Achebe: This week, we will be discussing leadership; more specifically, we will be examining the various qualities found in all successful business leaders. To get you thinking about this topic, I'd like you to consider the following question: What is more important for being an effective leader of a business excellent communication skills or a strong technical background in a particular industry?
Andrew: The best leaders are the ones who are good communicators. If employees clearly understand what is expected of them—if their leader can articulate clearly and concisely what they need to do to achieve their goals-they will be more productive and efficient in their work.
Kelly: It doesn't matter how well a company's leader communicates if they don't have a deep understanding of the business itself. Employees aren't going to be motivated by a company president who gives a great speech if it's evident that the president doesn't know what they do in their day-to-day work.

In your response, you should do the following. • Express and support your opinion. • Make a contribution to the discussion in your own words. An effective response will contain at least 100 words.
Doctor Gupta: This week, we'll study an issue that is often debated by economists. There are many large industries that, while providing significant economic benefits, engage in practices that result in environmental harm. Some would argue that economic success should never come at the cost of damage to the environment. Do you agree with this view? Why or why not?
Paul: I can't say I agree. Everyone talks about protecting natural resources, but what about protecting humans? Humans need the ability to work and provide for their families, and sometimes this means creating jobs through industries that might contribute to pollution. Those industries can just be monitored by environmental agencies. That's a win-win solution.
Kelly: I see your point, Paul, but I don't think there are many industries that are so essential for the economy that their impact on the environment can be ignored or merely "monitored." Continual environmental damage will one day lead to the extinction of species that are essentials to agriculture. That will endanger our food chain.

Kelly: People already pay so much in taxes for things like schools, roads, and law enforcement. I don't think that adding one more tax-especially when some people don't even use public transportation-would be a good idea. People need money for other essentials for their families.
Paul: Free public transportation would result in having fewer cars on the roads. Also, it would mean cleaner air for the cities, and there are many health conditions that could be improved with cleaner air. I think the savings in health-care costs and less pollution would make it worth it.
Doctor Diaz: Starting this week, we will discuss how public transportation is funded. Public transportation gives people from all social groups access to their homes, workplaces, and shopping. Some argue that public transportation should be supported by tax revenue so that all people could have free access to it. What do you think? Should public transportation be free to all? Why or why not?

Doctor Diaz: This week, we will be looking at how consumers feel about their purchases of technology. Many people find that buying devices such as mobile phones or personal computers can be very difficult. They feel like they're not prepared to make the best decision to suit their needs. In your posts, I want you to discuss the following question: What do you believe is the biggest mistake that people make when buying tech products? Explain what this mistake is.
Claire: I think one problem is that people don't match the product's capabilities to their actual needs. My brother just got a new mobile phone, and he is very excited about how highly rated the camera is. But he hardly ever takes photos. So he paid for a feature that he doesn't really need.
Paul: When people buy a new piece of hardware, like a laptop, they often don't consider the software they are purchasing along with the hardware. If the software is not what you are used to or doesn't work with your existing files, it can be frustrating to learn a new way of using your laptop.

Professor Henson: When people are asked about the most important discoveries or inventions made in the last two hundred years, they usually mention something very obvious, like the computer or the cell phone. But there are thousands of other discoveries or inventions that have had a huge impact on how we live today. What scientific discovery or technological invention from the last 200 years— other than computers and cell phones-would you choose as being important? Why?
Paul N: I mean, we're so used to science and technology that we are not even aware of all the things we use in our daily lives. I would probably choose space satellites. This technology happened in the last hundred years, and it has become important for so many things. Just think about navigation, or telecommunications, or even the military.
Lena A: I am thinking about medical progress. Like, for example, when scientists discovered things about healthy nutrition. I am thinking of identifying all the vitamins we need to stay healthy. I am not sure exactly when the vitamin discoveries happened, but I know they are very important. Our health is much better than it was 200 years ago.

Dr. Diaz: We are all exposed to a lot of advertising, especially on the internet. And of course businesses spend a lot of money to create and distribute advertising. Before next class, I would like for you to discuss this question: Is advertising just a way of manipulating people to buy things they do not need, or is it an important source of information that helps people make informed consumer decisions?
Karen: I don't think most people consider ads to be valuable. I read that in just one one year, from 2018 to 2019, the number of computers, tablets and and mobile phones using ad blockers increased from 142 million to 615 million.
Brad: People can find out a lot about products from advertising. There's plenty of evidence that people usually begin the process of making a big purchase by looking at ads and reviews. I have to go to another class right now, but I'm going to post later about an advertisement that gave me a lot of useful information.

Dr. Gupta: As I mentioned in class, governments make public policies to describe their responses to various problems that affect a community. Part of this process involves setting and defending priorities about which issues deserve the most attention and resources. For example, governments need to decide whether they should spend more money on education or on environmental protections. If you were a policy maker, which issue would you argue is more important-education or environmental protections? Why?
Sara: We all live on planet Earth, and it is the only planet we have. Therefore, we must take care of it. Clearly, protecting the environment should be the government's priority over education. I think the REAL question is, which approach to protecting the environment-restricting pollution, regulating population, promoting clean energy, or something else-should be the government's priority.
Teahyun: I disagree with Sara that that the environment is more important than education. Education is actually the best way to protect the environment. Educated people can see how their decisions affect the world around them. Also, with better Taehyun O. science and technology education, we can develop solutions to environmental problems. Therefore, I think the government should spend more money on education.

So here's a question for the class discussion board: What do you think is the most significant effect that watching television has on people? Why do you think television has this effect?
Kelly: I know that one way that television influences people's behavior is that when you are watching television, you are not moving around or exercising. This is especially true for children. When children spend a lot of time watching television, they have a greater tendency to be overweight.
Paul: I think the main effect that television has on people is to broaden their experience. There are so many programs devoted to nature and travel. Think of all the different places in the world you can experience through television! Last night I watched a program about life in Antarctica, and it was fascinating!

This week, we’ll be discussing ways to address air pollution. One idea is introducing environmental taxes on air travel. Such taxes also referred to as ecological taxes or green taxes, are extra charges that get added to the price of airplane tickets. Money collected from these taxes could be invested in environmentally friendly technologies or in promoting other cleaner modes of transportation. Do you think there should be an environmental tax on air travel? Why or why not?
Andrew
We should impose environmental taxes on air travel. These taxes might encourage people to find cheaper, more eco-friendly ways to get places. In my country, many people use planes to fly a short distance because flights are relatively cheap, when they could just as easily take a less polluting form of transportation. 
Claire 
Additional taxes on air travel will do little to solve the problem of air pollution. Airplane tickets would become more expensive, punishing passengers without incentivizing airlines to become more environmentally friendly. The airlines should pay the price to protect the environment, not their customers

We have been discussing government budgets and the difficult decisions governments must make regarding the use of public funds. Some services are clearly essential and must be paid for by and government. But what about public funding of the arts? Do you believe that governments should provide financial support to artists- for example, painters, sculptors, musicians, or filmmakers? Why or why not?
Claire
I enjoy art as much as anyone does, but public funds come from taxes, and I don't think taxpayers’ hard-earned money should be spent on impractical or inessential items and services. Artists should support themselves by selling their work to private individuals and companies. If they can't find enough buyers, then maybe they should change careers.
Paul
Personally, I think art actually is essential. Lots of public spaces in my hometown just wouldn't be the same without artwork. From statues in public parks to murals painted on the walls of government buildings, my hometown really benefits from funding the artists who created these works. The public spaces are simply more enjoyable for visitors because of the artwork.

High school curriculum is designed to ready students for future career paths, many of which include higher education. Whether or not students choose to attend college, a comprehensive high school education provides an essential foundation. Some educators argue that high schools have an obligation to provide career readiness training for students who do not intend to pursue a college degree. Should high schools invest time and money to develop programs for students who do not wish to continue their education beyond 12th grade? What is your opinion and why?
Paul
Career-readiness training should be provided for students who do not wish to pursue college and should be particularly targeted at students who are at risk of dropping out. By reframing their high school experience as training for successful careers rather than government-mandated learning, students can succeed where they may previously have failed.
Claire
Students who do not want to pursue higher education should not be given additional accommodations in high school, because they should not be provided any incentives to not attend college. College is the best way to learn how to be productive in the workforce, and students should be encouraged to attend, since it is in their best interest.

For most people, advertisements are nearly impossible to avoid. Whether watching TV, surfing the web, playing a video game or even reading an e-book, we are subjected to a near-constant wave of advertisements. Some advertisements, such as commercials on TV or the radio, are direct and overt. Other types of advertising more subtle, such as product placement, where the company pays to have its product featured prominently in TV or a video game. Given advertising‘s many forms and its consistent presence in our lives, it is worthwhile considering the influence of advertisements on the individual. What do you think and why?
Paul
Without ads, it would be difficult for us to make informed purchasing decisions: Ads not only tell us what products exist but also help us choose the products that best suit our needs. Ads provide us with various products to meet our needs and choose what we really need. 
Claire
Ads distort our sense of what is valuable and desirable. They create within us a false need and convince us that the way to fulfill that need is to buy the advertised products. Consumers may end up purchasing many unnecessary products and find them in financial difficulty.

Owing to the fast development of urbanization, a huge amount of people flushing into the city makes the city traffic become increasingly crowded, which makes it urgent for our government to improve transportation system. Should a government prioritize investing in public transport
system or facilitate people’s own use of private vehicles? 
Paul
I think government should give a priority to developing public transit system in order to solve traffic problems. Modernizing trains and buses, lowering ticket prices (fares), and expanding public transportation routes will help relieve the traffic jams on the road. 
Claire
Helping people own and use private vehicles, such as cars, by offering low-interest loans, keeping gasoline prices low, and building better roads is an efficient way to alleviate crowded public transports. Thus, by private cars, people can enjoy a more comfortable and convenient travel, especially for those who live in a remote area, without having to chock in the crowded carriage for a long time.

Dr. Achebe
A new story about new medical skills appears in the news almost daily. Of course, the government is spending a lot of money to develop new medical technology. Before the next class, I want you to consider the following questions: The new medical technology is effective, but with certain medical risks, in general, do you think the benefits outweigh the disadvantages, or do the disadvantages outweigh the benefits, for improving people's health?
Paul
I think the new medical technology is a threat to society. With the progress of new science and technology, some people will use the new medical technology to make money because the price is high, so people need to pay a greater price, and it also becomes a means of profit for some people with bad intentions. At the same time, there may be high risk, because the new technology leads to people's health risks. 
Claire
I disagree with Paul. I think the new medical technology is a progressive tool. It has the potential to solve many of the world's problems, from small diseases to serious diseases. Moreover, new medical technologies can help us make better decisions by analyzing large amounts of data and identifying patterns that humans may miss. Of course, we must ensure that the government develops and uses it in a responsible way that benefits the society as a whole.

Doctor Achebe:
In the next few weeks. we‘ll be talking about urban traffic management. Let's begin by discussing one popular idea-- creating car-free central zones. Some cities around the world have recently designated their downtown areas as being automobile-free which means that vehicles are not allowed to enter the city centers. Do you think that more cities should make their central zones car-free? Why or why not?
Claire
I support the idea of establishing car-free central zones because this will result in one important benefit for city residents-it will be better for their health. Instead of driving everywhere, people will be encouraged to walk or cycle more. It would be a great way to incorporate exercise into people’s routines.
Paul
It sounds like a good idea but I'm skeptical. My main concern is that many businesses located in the city centers such as shops and restaurants may suffer because the customers will no longer be able to reach those businesses by car. For some customers, if they can't drive, they won't go at all.

We are looking this week at different ways businesses market their products and services especially nontraditional methods. One thing that marketers pay close attention to is online reviews of their products. A business might include customer reviews on their website or carefully monitor the reviews on third-party sites. I would like you to discuss your own experiences with online reviews. Do you find them useful when deciding whether or not to buy a product?
Claire
I think online reviews are a great source of information because they are written by ordinary customers who are like me. For instance, when I read a restaurant review by a professional food critic, I'm not interested in some of the details that are included, like how the food is prepared. I'm more interested in aspects like the quality of the food and the service, which regular customers usually comment on 
Andrew
To me, online reviews have some real problems. First, people are more likely to post reviews after a bad experience than after a good one. As a result, what you read is often weighted toward the negative. Also, you have no way of knowing whether reviewers know what they are talking about or even if they actually bought and used the product they are reviewing.

This week. well examine issues in education reform. for example, some educators think that by focusing mainly on foundational knowledge in subjects like reading math and science, schools are not fully preparing students for success in the workplace. These educators argue that softskills-nonacademic skills such as being empathetic or having a strong work ethic- should be part of the curriculum, with classroom time dedicated to developing these skills. Do you agree? Why or why not?
Claire
I agree. While students need a strong foundation in academic subjects, soft skills are important because they affect how we students do their work. If classroom time is set aside for these skills, students will take them seriously and their academic work will benefit. Teachers could design lessons so that students learn about a skill and then do role-playing activities with classmates.
Andrew
Soft skills are important, but I don't agree with using classroom time to work on them. I'm not sure how teachers would measure students' progress in developing these skills. If students’ progress can't be measured on something being taught, I'm not sure if there's any point to teaching it.

This week we are talking about how different cities choose to either preserve or replace older, historic buildings. Some cities have strict rules about preserving older buildings and homes, especially those with historic architecture. Others tend to encourage new construction to replace structures that are aging and decaying. Should cities try to save historic buildings or replace them with more modern ones? 
Paul
I think the preservation of old historic buildings involves a lot of problems, especially in densely populated cities. In modern cities, land is very valuable, and old buildings just do not provide as much living and working space as modern high-rise buildings. Also, they were not built to modern standards, so they may waste energy through inefficient heating and cooling
Kelly
It's important to preserve historic buildings. Keeping original architecture helps preserve a city's culture. Even on the practical side, most big cities get an economic benefit from tourism, and historic buildings like hotels and theaters are big attractions. Who wants to visit a city where all the buildings are glass and steel and look like buildings in every other city?

In class this week, we are looking at how markets work, particularly in regard to energy costs. Petroleum, also known simply as oil, is one of the most important international commodities. When the global market price of oil goes up, fuels such as gasoline (petrol) also become more expensive. Many people think governments should step in to protect consumers from increases in fuel prices What is your view? Do you think governments should actively keep fuel prices low for consumers?
Kelly
I think it's a good government policy. Most people have to drive or use public transportation, like a bus, to get to work. When the price of gasoline goes up, it costs them more to get to work. People don’t have a choice about whether to go to work or not, so they should be protected from price increases.
Andrew
I think the government keeping gas prices low is a bad policy. The biggest problem we face now is global climate change. The more expensive gasoline is, the less people will drive, and thus they will contribute fewer greenhouse gases to the air. Lowering the cost of gas just makes the problem worse.

Let's continue talking about consumer behavior. We have been discussing different ways people go about choosing what products to buy, and there are many potential sources of information and advice for consumers. In your opinion, which is the better strategy for making purchasing decisions, relying on advice from friends and family, or depending on information from online sources? Why? 
Claire
Asking friends and family members for product recommendations might seem like an easier option, but it might take too much time to get all the information you need. An internet search would be much more efficient. There are many consumer magazines available online that compile lots of data to compare the advantages and disadvantages of one product versus another
Paul
The last time I bought a computer, I just watched a few videos online to make a decision, and now I regret that. My friends could have advised me better because they know my preferences and the kind of features that I am interested in. Consumers should get advice from the people around them to find the most suitable products

Automation is a much-discussed topic in economics, one that continues to grow in importance with today's advances in robotics and artificial intelligence, or Al. Robots and Al provide powerful ways to replace human labor by doing work better and faster than people can. Automation can have very positive effects on businesses and the broader economy, but there are disadvantages as well. What do you think? Ls the use of automation a positive development overall? Why or why not?
Paul
I think the use of automation is a positive development. If Al and robots are used instead of human workers, companies will be able to produce many more products than they do now. They can also lower costs, making those products cheaper for people to buy. As a result, everyone will have access to more-affordable products.
Kelly
I worry about the psychological effects on people as Al and robots take over work. I doubt humans will really be happy with ever-greater amounts of leisure time. Many of us derive satisfaction from working and doing our jobs well. In fact, never in human history have we been able to spend large parts of our days labor-free.

This week, we are discussing the social psychology of sports. We have learned that sports often have positive psychological effects on athletes, such as the members of sports teams. But how can we describe their effects on other groups of people, such as sports enthusiasts or sports fans? Consider the following question: When people spend a lot of time watching sports or following their favorite team, does it have a negative effect on their lives? Why or why not?
Claire
I agree that focusing on sports too much can have negative impacts. For example, some people who like watching sports on television have few other interests. In fact,zit seems like watching sports is all they're interested in. I sometimes find such people annoying because they care too much about things that don't matter. 
Paul
I am not sure what we mean by spending "a lot of time" following sports. But following sports has helped me in life. When I first met one of my best friends, Daphne, I started a conversation with her by saying something about a sports team I liked. Then we moved to other topics, but sports were a great conservation-starter.

Today, we are going to discuss an emerging work arrangement known as job sharing. Job sharing is a type of employment in which one full-time position can be shared by two part-time workers; that is, the two people share the work, hours, and pay of one job. For example, two part-time accountants share one full-time accounting position, splitting the responsibilities of the position. Do you think the job-sharing arrangement is a positive trend? Why or why not?
Claire
I’m not sure job sharing is a good idea. I think it would be too confusing for employers to keep track of who is working on which day or who is responsible for certain projects. Coworkers who have questions about certain projects would also get confused about which person to address their questions to.
Paul
I think job sharing can lead to more fulfilling lives for a lot of people. Many workers want to continue developing their careers but don't want to spend so much time working full- time jobs. Some people want to spend time developing their hobbies or taking classes, for example. Job sharing could be very convenient for their schedules.

One social phenomenon we discussed recently is this: when a person is in some trouble, some people help that person, while many others do nothing. Some people conclude that inaction-that is, doing nothing-makes the world a worse place. In your post, please discuss the causes or the effects of this social phenomenon; in other words, what are some reasons why people might choose not to help others, or what are some results of this inaction?
Andrew
In my opinion, one of the main causes behind this phenomenon of people not helping others is concern for our own interests. If I come across someone in a situation who needs help, I will want to help that person-but not if it creates some significant problem for me. Doing so will simply put us both in a bad situation.
Kelly
I agree that inaction makes the world worse. That means that we all have the responsibility to make the world a better place. An important effect of people not taking on this responsibility is that we may feel less trusting of our neighbors. Conversely, when others show that they are willing t& help people, our community becomes stronger.

This week we will discuss issues faced by secondary school administrators. I'm referring.to schools for teenage students. One such issue is students who change schools. Students change, schools for many different reasons, the most common being a family move. On the discussion board, I want you to exchange ideas about what schools can do to make the transition to a new school easier for teenagers.
Paul
I think schools should assign new students a fellow student who can help them adjust. The "student buddy" can do things like make sure the new student can find the cafeteria or the right classrooms. For new students, it's a lot easier to ask a fellow student a question rather than ask a teacher or the principal.
Claire
I would require new students to sign up for some school club or activity that meets outside of class. That way, new students would have an easy way to meet other students in a friendly environment. It would give them a group to immediately identify with.

Professor: Today we’re going to talk about the debate between economic growth and protecting the environment. Economic growth creates new jobs and gives people money they can use to improve their lives. On the other hand, if we protect the environment it can be enjoyed both by ourselves and future generations. If you had to choose between prioritizing economic growth or protecting the environment, which one would you choose. Why?
Alex: I would prioritize the environment. We only have one planet and if we don’t take care of it, we won’t have pleasant lives in the future. Economic growth can be important, but not at the expense of the environment. I think we need to shift towards more environmentally-friendly economic practices, such as investing in renewable energy and promoting environmentally-friendly technologies. We’ll all live much healthier lives if the world around us is clean.
Maggie: While I agree with Alex that environmental sustainability is important, I think that economic growth is the only way to solve many of the social and economic problems we face. We need a strong economy to create jobs, reduce poverty, and improve standards of living. Not only that, but if companies grow stronger and more profitable, they might eventually develop new technologies that solve our environmental problems.

Professor: Today, we’re discussing the ethics of targeted advertising. Some people argue that online advertising which uses personal information to target specific people is an invasion of privacy. Others argue that it’s simply an acceptable way to reach consumers with products and services they’re interested in. What’s your take? Do you think targeted advertising is ethical, or is it an invasion of privacy?
Jessica: I think targeted advertising is an invasion of privacy. Advertisers shouldn’t be able to track and use our personal information to sell us products. It’s not fair to consumers, and it’s a violation of our rights. Instead, advertisers should focus on creating high-quality ads that appeal to a broad audience.
Mike: I disagree with Jessica. I think targeted advertising is ethical. It’s a more efficient way to reach consumers with products and services that are relevant to their interests. Plus, consumers can always opt-out of targeted advertising by adjusting their privacy settings. As long as advertisers give users a choice, I think targeted advertising can be beneficial for both businesses and consumers.

Professor: Today, we’re going to discuss the impact of social media on society. On one hand, social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have connected people from all over the world. However, there are concerns about the negative effects of social media, such as the spread of misinformation, the rise of cyberbullying, and addiction to social media use. What do you think? Does social media cause more harm than good?
Sarah: I think that social media has caused more harm than good. While it’s true that social media platforms have connected people in unprecedented ways, they have also caused real harm to individuals and societies. Additionally, social media platforms have been linked to mental health problems such as anxiety and depression, particularly among young people.
Mark: I disagree with Sara. I think that social media has mostly improved society. For instance, it has given a voice to people that previously were ignored. Moreover, it has provided a platform for political activism that has led to positive change. And, of course, social media has made it easy for everyone to stay connected to family and friends who are far away. While there are negative aspects of social media, they are far outweighed by the benefits.

Professor: In class today, we are going to talk about grading students. Before you come to class, I want you to think about whether grades are beneficial. On one hand, they provide a way to measure students’ progress. On the other hand, some argue that grades are too focused on performance and don’t provide an accurate picture of a student’s overall academic abilities. If you had to choose, would you say that students should be given grades or not? Why?
Lila: I think that students should not be given grades. Grades create a needlessly competitive environment and can make students feel like they are only valued for their academic performance. This can be harmful to their mental health and can discourage them. Instead of giving specific grades, teachers should provide personal feedback that helps students understand what they need to improve and how they can do so.
Jake: I disagree. I believe that grades are the only way for students to understand how well they are doing and the only way to motivate them to work harder. Without grades, there would be no way to measure their progress or to identify areas where they need to improve. Moreover, grades prepare students for the real world where they will be judged based on their performance.

Professor: Today we’re going to discuss whether the government should tax unhealthy products, such as sugary drinks and junk food. On one hand, taxing these products could discourage people from consuming them and reduce health problems. On the other hand, some argue that such taxes unfairly target lower-income families who may rely on these products as affordable sources of food. If you had to choose, would you support or oppose taxing unhealthy products? Why?
Sam: I support the idea of taxing unhealthy products. These products are often high in sugar, salt, and fat, which can lead to serious health problems such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. As you said, by taxing these products, the government can discourage people from consuming them and resolve some of these health issues. Moreover, the revenue generated from such taxes can be used to fund advertising campaigns that promote healthy eating habits.
Tanya: I disagree. I believe that such taxes are unfair to families that don’t have a lot of money. Wealthy people will not care about the taxes and their habits won’t change. Additionally, if these taxes are implemented people might try to save money by purchasing lower-quality products that are cheaper in the first place. That means they could suffereven more health problems.

Professor: A new story about Artificial Intelligence (AI) is in the news almost every day. And, of course, companies are spending an enormous amount of money to develop new technologies related to AI. Before next class, I want you to consider the following question: Is AI a dangerous technology that, overall, will be harmful to society, or is it a powerful tool that will improve the lives of people?
Megan: Personally, I think AI is a threat to society. As AI technology advances, many jobs may become automated, leaving people without work and that will certainly increase income inequality. Additionally, there’s the risk that AI systems could be programmed with biases or used to discriminate against certain groups. We need to be careful and ensure that AI is developed in an ethical and responsible way. Since we can’t guarantee that right now, I think it is best to slow down when it comes to this kind of technology.
David: I disagree with Megan. I’m of the opinion that AI is a tool for progress. It has the potential to solve many of the world’s problems, from climate change to disease. Additionally, AI can help us make better decisions by analyzing vast amounts of data and identifying patterns that humans may miss. That said, I agree with Megan that we must ensure that AI is developed and used in a responsible way that benefits society as a whole.

Professor: Life expectancies are increasing all over the world nowadays. Some of you probably know someone who is more than 100 years old. Before our next class, I want you to consider the following question: What factors do you think have contributed to the increase in life expectancy? Is it due to advances in medical technology, improvements in public health, changes in lifestyle habits, or something else entirely?
Lisa: I think the main reason why people are living longer nowadays is recent advances in medical technology. Modern medicine has enabled us to better treat and manage chronic illnesses, and there have been major breakthroughs in areas such as cancer treatment and organ transplantation. As a result, people are able to live longer with diseases that may have been fatal in the past.
John: While medical technology has certainly played a role, I think improvements in public health have been just as important. We now have access to clean drinking water, sanitation systems, and vaccines that have dramatically reduced the incidence of infectious diseases. Even a century ago, people didn’t  have access to any of these things. Additionally, public health campaigns have helped educate people about healthy lifestyle habits such as exercise, healthy eating, and not smoking, which can also contribute to longer lifespans.

Professor: Funding for education is a really hot topic nowadays, so today we’re going to talk about how universities use their limited resources. In the discussion board please respond to the following question: Should universities prioritize funding academic facilities like libraries, or is it okay to spend just as much money on sports and athletic programs? 
Rachel: I think universities should prioritize funding for libraries. Libraries are essential for academic research and study, and they provide students with access to information and resources that they might not have otherwise. Investing in libraries can also help attract and retain the most talented professors, which can ultimately benefit the university as a whole. Sports, on the other hand, appeal to just a small percentage of people. Even in ourschool, most students aren’t on a sports team and don’t make use of the fitness center or athletic fields.
Mike: While I agree that libraries are important, I think that sports programs should also be a priority for universities. Sports can bring the campus community together, even if that just means they attend sports and cheer for their favorite athletes. Meanwhile, among the athletes themselves, sports promote teamwork and leadership skills. Additionally, successful sports programs can generate revenue for the university and boost its reputation.
